  <p>The genus <i>Peripatus</i> was established in 1826 by Guilding,<a id="NtA_1"
  href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> who first obtained specimens of it from St. Vincent in the
  Antilles. He regarded it as a Mollusc, being no doubt deceived by the slug-like appearance given
  by the antennae. Specimens were subsequently obtained from other parts of the Neotropical region
  and from South Africa and Australia, and the animal was variously assigned by the zoologists of
  the day to the Annelida and Myriapoda. Its true place in the system, as a primitive member of the
  group Arthropoda, was first established in 1874 by Moseley,<a id="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> who discovered the tracheae. The genus has been monographed by
  Sedgwick,<a id="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> who has also written an account of the
  development of the Cape species.<a id="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> A bibliography will
  be found in Sedgwick's Monograph.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page4"><span class="smaller">{4}</span></span></div>

  <p>There can be no doubt that <i>Peripatus</i> is an Arthropod, for it possesses the following
  features, all characteristic of that group, and all of first-class morphological importance: (1)
  The presence of appendages modified as jaws; (2) the presence of paired lateral ostia perforating
  the wall of the heart and putting its cavity in communication with the pericardium; (3) the
  presence of a vascular body cavity and pericardium (haemocoelic body cavity); (4) absence of a
  perivisceral section of the coelom. Finally, the tracheae, though not characteristic of all the
  classes of the Arthropoda, are found nowhere outside that group, and constitute a very important
  additional reason for uniting <i>Peripatus</i> with it.</p>

  <p><i>Peripatus</i>, though indubitably an Arthropod, differs in such important respects from all
  the old-established Arthropod classes, that a special class, equivalent in rank to the others, and
  called Prototracheata, has had to be created for its sole occupancy. This unlikeness to other
  Arthropoda is mainly due to the Annelidan affinities which it presents, but in part to the
  presence of the following peculiar features: (1) The number and diffusion of the tracheal
  apertures; (2) the restriction of the jaws to a single pair; (3) the disposition of the generative
  organs; (4) the texture of the skin; and (5) the simplicity and similarity of all the segments of
  the body behind the head.</p>

  <p>The Annelidan affinities are superficially indicated in so marked a manner by the thinness of
  the cuticle, the dermo-muscular body wall, the hollow appendages, that, as already stated, many of
  the earlier zoologists who examined <i>Peripatus</i> placed it amongst the segmented worms; and
  the discovery that there is some solid morphological basis for this determination constitutes one
  of the most interesting points of the recent work on the genus. The Annelidan features are: (1)
  The paired nephridia in every segment of the body behind the first two (Saenger, Balfour<a
  id="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>); (2) the presence of cilia in the generative tracts
  (Gaffron). It is true that neither of these features are absolutely distinctive of the Annelida,
  but when taken in conjunction with the Annelidan disposition of the chief systems of organs, viz.
  the central nervous system, and the main vascular trunk or heart, may be considered as indicating
  affinities in that <span class="pagenum" id="page5"><span
  class="smaller">{5}</span></span>direction. <i>Peripatus</i>, therefore, is zoologically of
  extreme interest from the fact that, though in the main Arthropodan, it possesses features which
  are possessed by no other Arthropod, and which connect it to the group to which the Arthropoda are
  in the general plan of their organisation most closely related. It must, therefore, according to
  our present lights, be regarded as a very primitive form; and this view of it is borne out by its
  extreme isolation at the present day. <i>Peripatus</i> stands absolutely alone as a kind of
  half-way animal between the Arthropoda and Annelida. There is no gradation of structure within the
  genus; the species are very limited in number, and in all of them the peculiar features above
  mentioned are equally sharply marked.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Peripatus</i>, though a lowly organised animal, and of remarkable sluggishness,
  with but slight development of the higher organs of sense, with eyes the only function of which is
  to enable it to avoid the light&mdash;though related to those animals most repulsive to the
  aesthetic sense of man, animals which crawl upon their bellies and spit at, or poison, their
  prey&mdash;is yet, strange to say, an animal of striking beauty. The exquisite sensitiveness and
  constantly changing form of the antennae, the well-rounded plump body, the eyes set like small
  diamonds on the side of the head, the delicate feet, and, above all, the rich colouring and
  velvety texture of the skin, all combine to give these animals an aspect of quite exceptional
  beauty. Of all the species which I have seen alive, the most beautiful are the dark green
  individuals of <i>Capensis</i>, and the species which I have called <i>Balfouri</i>. These
  animals, so far as skin is concerned, are not surpassed in the animal kingdom. I shall never
  forget my astonishment and delight when on bearing away the bark of a rotten tree-stump in the
  forest on Table Mountain, I first came upon one of these animals in its natural haunts, or when
  Mr. Trimen showed me in confinement at the South African Museum a fine fat, full-grown female,
  accompanied by her large family of thirty or more just-born but pretty young, some of which were
  luxuriously creeping about on the beautiful skin of their mother's back.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>External Features.</b></p>

  <p>The anterior part of the body may be called the head, though it is not sharply marked off from

  <p>The head carries three pairs of appendages, a pair of simple eyes, and a ventrally placed
  mouth. The body is elongated and vermiform; it bears a number of paired appendages, each
  terminating in a pair of claws, and all exactly alike. The number varies in the different species.
  The anus is always at the posterior end of the body, and the generative opening is on the ventral
  surface just in front of the anus; it may be between the legs of the last pair (Fig. 2), or it may
  be behind them. There is in most species a thin median white line extending the whole length of
  the dorsal surface of the body, on each side of which the skin pigment is darker than elsewhere.
  The colour varies considerably in the different species, and even in different individuals of the
  same species. The ventral surface is nearly always flesh-coloured, while the dorsal surface has a
  darker colour. In the <span class="pagenum" id="page7"><span
  class="smaller">{7}</span></span>South African species the colour of the dorsal surface varies
  from a dark green graduating to a bluish gray, to a brown varying to a red orange. The colour of
  the Australasian species varies in like manner, while that of the Neotropical species (S. American
  and W. Indian) is less variable. The skin is thrown into a number of transverse ridges, along
  which wart-like papillae are placed. The papillae, which are found everywhere, are specially
  developed on the dorsal surface, less so on the ventral. Each papilla carries at its extremity a
  well-marked spine.</p>

  <p>The appendages of the head are the antennae, the jaws and the oral papillae.</p>

  <p>The antennae, which are prolongations of the dorso-lateral parts of the head, are ringed, and
  taper slightly till near their termination, where they are slightly enlarged. The rings bear a
  number of spines, and the free end of the antennae is covered by a cap of spiniferous tissue like
  that of the rings.</p>

      (After Balfour.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The mouth is at the hinder end of a depression called the buccal cavity, and is surrounded by
  an annular tumid lip, raised into papilliform ridges and bearing a few spines (Fig. 3). Within the
  buccal cavity are the two jaws. They are short, stump-like, muscular structures, armed at their
  free extremities by a pair of cutting blades or claws, and are placed one on each side of the
  mouth. In the median line of the buccal cavity in front is placed a thick muscular protuberance,
  which may be called the tongue, though attached to the dorsal instead of to the ventral wall of
  the mouth (Fig. 3). The tongue bears a row of small chitinous teeth. The jaw-claws (Figs. 4 and
  5), which resemble in all essential points the claws borne by the feet, and like these are
  thickenings of the cuticle, are sickle-shaped. They have their convex edge directed forwards and
  their concave or cutting edge turned backwards. The inner cutting plate (Fig. 4) usually bears a
  number of cutting teeth. The jaws appear to be used for tearing the food, to which the mouth
  adheres by means of the tumid suctorial lips. The oral papillae are placed at the sides of the
  head (Fig. 3). The <span class="pagenum" id="page8"><span class="smaller">{8}</span></span>ducts
  of the slime-glands open at their free end. They possess two main rings of projecting tissue, and
  their extremities bear papillae irregularly arranged.</p>

  <p>The ambulatory appendages vary in number. There are seventeen pairs in <i>P. capensis</i> and
  eighteen in <i>P. Balfouri</i>, while in <i>P. Edwardsii</i> the number varies from twenty-nine to
  thirty-four pairs. They consist of two main divisions, which we may call the leg and the foot
  (Figs. 6 and 7). The leg (<i>l</i>) has the form of a truncated cone, the broad end of which is
  attached to the ventro-lateral wall of the body, of which it is a prolongation. It is marked by a
  number of rings of papillae placed transversely to its long axis, the dorsal of which are
  pigmented like the dorsal surface of the body, and the ventral like the ventral surface. At the
  narrow distal end of the leg there are on the ventral surface three spiniferous pads, each of
  which is continued dorsally into a row of papillae.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The foot is attached to the distal end of the leg. It is slightly narrower at its attached
  extremity than at its free end. It bears two sickle-shaped claws and a few papillae. The part of
  the foot which carries the claws is especially retractile, and is generally found more or less
  telescoped into the proximal part. The legs of the fourth and fifth pairs differ from the others
  in <span class="pagenum" id="page9"><span class="smaller">{9}</span></span>the fact that the
  proximal pad is broken up into three, a small central and two larger lateral. The enlarged
  nephridia of these legs open on the small central division.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The males are generally rather smaller than the females. In those species in which
  the number of legs varies, the male has a smaller number of legs than the female.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Habits.</b></p>

  <p>They live beneath the bark of rotten stumps of trees, in the crevices of rock, and beneath
  stones. They require a moist atmosphere, and are exceedingly susceptible to drought. They avoid
  light, and are therefore rarely seen. They move with great deliberation, picking their course by
  means of their antennae and eyes. It is by the former that they acquire a knowledge of the ground
  over which they are travelling, and by the latter that they avoid the light. The antennae are
  extraordinarily sensitive, and so delicate, indeed, that they seem to be able to perceive the
  nature of objects without actual contact. When irritated they eject with considerable force the
  contents of their slime reservoirs from the oral papillae. The force is supplied by the sudden
  contraction of the muscular body wall. They can squirt the slime to the distance of almost a foot.
  The slime, which appears to be perfectly harmless, is extremely sticky, but it easily comes away
  from the skin of the animal itself.</p>

  <p>I have never seen them use this apparatus for the capture of prey, but Hutton describes the New
  Zealand species as using it for this purpose. So far as I can judge, it is used as a defensive
  weapon; but this of course will not exclude its offensive use. They will turn their heads to any
  part of the body which is being irritated and violently discharge their slime at the offending
  object. Locomotion is effected entirely by means of the legs, with the body fully extended.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Of their food in the natural state we know little; but it is probably mainly, if
  not entirely, animal. Hutton describes his specimens as sucking the juices of flies which they had
  stuck down with their slime, and those which I kept in captivity eagerly devoured the entrails of
  their fellows, and the developing young from the uterus. They also like raw sheep's liver. They
  move their mouths in a suctorial manner, tearing the food with their jaws. They have the power of
  extruding their jaws from <span class="pagenum" id="page10"><span
  class="smaller">{10}</span></span>the mouth, and of working them alternately backwards or
  forwards. This is readily observed in individuals immersed in water.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Breeding.</b></p>

  <p>All species are viviparous. It has been lately stated that one of the Australian species is
  normally oviparous, but this has not been proved. The Australasian species come nearest to laying
  eggs, inasmuch as the eggs are large, full of yolk, and enclosed in a shell; but development
  normally takes place in the uterus, though, abnormally, incompletely developed eggs are
  extruded.</p>

  <p>The young of <i>P. capensis</i> are born in April and May. They are almost colourless at birth,
  excepting the antennae, which are green, and their length is 10 to 15 mm. A large female will
  produce thirty to forty young in one year. The period of gestation is thirteen months, that is to
  say, the ova pass into the oviducts about one month before the young of the preceding year are
  born. They are born one by one, and it takes some time for a female to get rid of her whole stock
  of embryos; in fact, the embryos in any given female differ slightly in age, those next the
  oviduct being a little older (a few hours) than those next the vagina. The mother does not appear
  to pay any special attention to her young, which wander away and get their own food.</p>

  <p>There does not appear to be any true copulation. The male deposits small, white, oval
  spermatophores, which consist of small bundles of spermatozoa cemented together by some glutinous
  substance, indiscriminately on any part of the body of the female. Such spermatophores are found
  on the bodies of both males and females from July to January, but they appear to be most numerous
  in our autumn. It seems probable that the spermatozoa make their way from the adherent
  spermatophore through the body wall into the body, and so by traversing the tissues reach the
  ovary. The testes are active from June to the following March. From March to June the vesiculae of
  the male are empty.</p>

  <p>There are no other sexual differences except in some of the South African species, in which the
  last or penultimate leg of the male bears a small white papilla on its ventral surface (Fig.
  6).</p>

  <p>Whereas in the Cape species embryos in the same uterus are all practically of the same age
  (except in the month of April, when two broods overlap in <i>P. capensis</i>), and birth takes
  place at a fixed season; in the Neotropical species the uterus, which is <span class="pagenum"
  id="page11"><span class="smaller">{11}</span></span>always pregnant, contains embryos of different
  ages, and births probably take place all the year round.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In all species of <i>Peripatus</i> the young are fully formed at birth, and differ
  from the adults only in size and colour.</p>

  <p class="ac">ANATOMY</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>The Alimentary Canal</b> (Fig. 8).</p>

      to show the alimentary canal, slime glands, and salivary glands. (After Balfour.) The
      dissection is viewed from the ventral side, and the lips (<i>L</i>) have been cut through in
      the middle line behind and pulled outwards so as to expose the jaws (<i>j</i>), which have
      been turned outwards, and the tongue (<i>T</i>) bearing a median row of chitinous teeth, which
      branches behind into two. The muscular pharynx, extending back into the space between the
      first and second pairs of legs, is followed by a short tubular oesophagus. The latter opens
      into the large stomach with plicated walls, extending almost to the hind end of the animal.
      The stomach at its point of junction with the rectum presents an <span class="sans
      fwb">S</span>-shaped ventro-dorsal curve. <i>A</i>, Anus; <i>at</i>, antenna; <i>F.1</i>,

      slime gland; <i>st</i>, stomach; <i>T</i>, tongue in roof of mouth.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">The buccal cavity, as explained above, is a secondary formation around the true
  mouth, which is at its dorsal posterior end. It contains the tongue and the jaws, which have
  already been described, and into the hind end of it there opens ventrally by a median opening the
  salivary glands (<i>s.g</i>). The mouth leads into a muscular pharynx (<i>ph</i>), which is
  connected by a short oesophagus (<i>oe</i>) with a stomach (<i>st</i>). The stomach forms by far
  the <span class="pagenum" id="page12"><span class="smaller">{12}</span></span>largest part of the
  alimentary canal. It is a dilated soft-walled tube, and leads behind into the short narrow rectum
  (<i>R</i>), which opens at the anus. There are no glands opening into the alimentary canal.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Nervous System.</b></p>

  <p>The central nervous system consists of a pair of supra-oesophageal ganglia united in the middle
  line, and of a pair of widely divaricated ventral cords, continuous in front with the
  supra-oesophageal ganglia (Fig. 9).</p>

  <p>The ventral cords at first sight appear to be without ganglionic thickenings, but on more
  careful examination they are found to be enlarged at each pair of legs (Fig. 9). These
  enlargements may be regarded as imperfect ganglia. There are, therefore, as many pairs of ganglia
  as there are pairs of legs. There is in addition a ganglionic enlargement at the commencement of
  the oesophageal commissures, where the nerves to the oral papillae are given off (Fig. 9,
  <i>or.g</i>).</p>

      Balfour.) The paired appendages (<i>d</i>) of the ventral surface of the brain are seen, and
      the pair of sympathetic nerves (<i>sy</i>) arising from the ventral surface of the hinder
      part. From the commencement of the oesophageal commissures pass off on each side a pair of
      nerves to the jaws (<i>Jn</i>). The three anterior commissures between the ventral nerve-cords
      are placed close together; immediately behind them the nerve-cords are swollen, to form the
      ganglionic enlargements from which pass off to the oral papillae a pair of large nerves on
      each side (<i>orn</i>). Behind this the cords present a series of enlargements, one pair for
      each pair of feet, from which a pair of large nerves pass off on each side to the feet
      (<i>pn</i>). <i>atn</i>, Antennary nerves; <i>co</i>, commissures between ventral cords;

      papillae pass off; <i>orn</i>, nerves to oral papillae; <i>pc</i>, posterior lobe of brain;
      <i>pn</i>, nerves to feet; <i>sy</i>, sympathetic nerves.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The ventral cords are placed each in the lateral compartments of the body cavity, immediately
  within the longitudinal layer of muscles. They are connected with each other, rather like the
  pedal nerves of <i>Chiton</i> and the lower Prosobranchiata, by a number of commissures. These
  commissures exhibit a <span class="pagenum" id="page13"><span
  class="smaller">{13}</span></span>fairly regular arrangement from the region included between the
  first and the last pair of true feet. There are nine or ten of them between each pair of feet.
  They pass along the ventral wall of the body, perforating the ventral mass of longitudinal
  muscles. On their way they give off nerves which innervate the skin.</p>

  <p>Posteriorly the two nerve-cords nearly meet immediately in front of the generative aperture,
  and then, bending upwards, fall into each other dorsally to the rectum. They give off a series of
  nerves from their outer borders, which present throughout the trunk a fairly regular arrangement.
  From each ganglion two large nerves (<i>pn</i>) are given off, which, diverging somewhat from each
  other, pass into the feet.</p>

  <p>From the oesophageal commissures, close to their junction with the supra-oesophageal ganglia, a
  nerve arises on each side which passes to the jaws, and a little in front of this, apparently from
  the supra-oesophageal ganglion itself, a second nerve to the jaws also takes its origin.</p>

  <p>The supra-oesophageal ganglia (Fig. 9) are large, somewhat oval masses, broader in front than
  behind, completely fused in the middle, but free at their extremities. Each of them is prolonged
  anteriorly into an antennary nerve, and is continuous behind with one of the oesophageal
  commissures. On the ventral surface of each, rather behind the level of the eye, is placed a
  hollow protuberance (Fig. 9, <i>d</i>), of which I shall say more in dealing with the development.
  About one-third of the way back the two large optic nerves take their origin, arising laterally,
  but rather from the dorsal surface (Fig. 9). Each of them joins a large ganglionic mass placed
  immediately behind the retina.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The histology of the ventral cords and oesophageal commissures is very simple and
  uniform. They consist of a cord almost wholly formed of nerve-fibres placed dorsally, and of a
  ventral layer of ganglion cells.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>The Body Wall.</b></p>

  <p>The skin is formed of three layers.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>(1) The cuticle.</p>
    <p>(2) The epidermis or hypodermis.</p>
    <p>(3) The dermis.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The cuticle is a thin layer. The spines, jaws, and claws are special developments of it. Its
  surface is not, however, smooth, <span class="pagenum" id="page14"><span
  class="smaller">{14}</span></span>but is everywhere, with the exception of the perioral region,
  raised into minute secondary papillae, which in most instances bear at their free extremity a
  somewhat prominent spine. The whole surface of each of the secondary papillae just described is in
  its turn covered by numerous minute spinous tubercles.</p>

  <p>The epidermis, placed immediately within the cuticle, is composed of a single layer of cells,
  which vary, however, a good deal in size in different regions of the body. The cells excrete the
  cuticle, and they stand in a very remarkable relation to the secondary papillae of the cuticle
  just described. Each epidermis cell is in fact placed within one of these secondary papillae, so
  that the cuticle of each secondary papilla is the product of a single epidermis cell. The pigment
  which gives the characteristic colour to the skin is deposited in the protoplasm of the outer ends
  of the cells in the form of small granules.</p>

  <p class="sp3">At the apex of most, if not all, the primary wart-like papillae there are present
  oval aggregations, or masses of epidermis cells, each such mass being enclosed in a thickish
  capsule and bearing a long projecting spine. These structures are probably tactile organs. In
  certain regions of the body they are extremely numerous; more especially is this the case in the
  antennae, lips, and oral papillae. On the ventral surface of the peripheral rings of the thicker
  sections of the feet they are also very thickly set and fused together so as to form a kind of pad
  (Figs. 6 and 7). In the antennae they are thickly set side by side on the rings of skin which give
  such an Arthropodan appearance to these organs in <i>Peripatus</i>.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>The Tracheal System.</b></p>

  <p>The apertures of the tracheal system are placed in the depressions between the papillae or
  ridges of the skin. Each of them leads into a tube, which may be called the tracheal pit (Fig.
  10), the walls of which are formed of epithelial cells bounded towards the lumen of the pit by a
  very delicate cuticular membrane continuous with the cuticle covering the surface of the body. The
  pits vary somewhat in depth; the pit figured was about 0.09 mm. It perforates the dermis and
  terminates in the subjacent muscular layer.</p>

  <p>Internally it expands in the transverse plane and from the expanded portion the tracheal tubes
  arise in diverging bundles. Nuclei similar in character to those in the walls of the tracheal
  <span class="pagenum" id="page15"><span class="smaller">{15}</span></span>pit are placed between
  the tracheae, and similar but slightly more elongated nuclei are found along the bundles. The
  tracheae are minute tubes exhibiting a faint transverse striation which is probably the indication
  of a spiral fibre. They appear to branch, but only exceptionally.  The tracheal apertures are
  diffused over the surface of the body, but are especially developed in certain regions.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="ac"><b>The Muscular System.</b></p>

  <p>The general muscular system consists of&mdash;(1) the general wall of the body; (2) the muscles
  connected with the mouth, pharynx, and jaws; (3) the muscles of the feet; (4) the muscles of the
  alimentary tract.</p>

  <p>The muscular wall of the body is formed of&mdash;(1) an external layer of circular fibres; (2)
  an internal layer of longitudinal muscles.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The main muscles of the body are unstriated and divided into fibres, each invested
  by a delicate membrane. The muscles of the jaws alone are transversely striated.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>The Vascular System.</b></p>

  <p class="sp3">The vascular system consists of a dorsal tubular heart with paired ostia leading
  into it from the pericardium, of the pericardium, and the various other divisions of the
  perivisceral cavity (Fig. 14, D). As in all Arthropoda, the perivisceral cavity is a haemocoele;
  <b>i.e.</b> it contains blood and forms part of the vascular system. The heart extends from close
  to the hind end of the body to the head.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page16"><span class="smaller">{16}</span></span></div>

  <p class="ac"><b>The Body Cavity.</b></p>

  <p class="sp3">The body cavity is formed of four compartments&mdash;one central, two lateral, and
  a pericardial (Fig. 14, D). The former is by far the largest, and contains the alimentary tract,
  the generative organs, and the slime glands. It is lined by a delicate endothelial layer, and is
  not divided into compartments nor traversed by muscular fibres. The lateral divisions are much
  smaller than the central, and are shut off from it by the inner transverse band of muscles. They
  are almost entirely filled with the nerve-cord and salivary gland in front and with the nerve-cord
  alone behind, and their lumen is broken up by muscular bands. They further contain the nephridia.
  They are prolonged into the feet, as is the embryonic body cavity of most Arthropoda. The
  pericardium contains a peculiar cellular tissue, probably, as suggested by Moseley, equivalent to
  the fat-bodies of insects.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Nephridia.</b></p>

  <p>In <i>Peripatus capensis</i> nephridia are present in all the legs. In all of them (except the
  first three) the following parts may be recognised (Fig. 11)<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p>(1) A vesicular portion opening to the exterior on the ventral surface of the legs by a
    narrow passage.</p>
    <p>(2) A coiled portion, which is again subdivided into several sections.</p>
    <p>(3) A section with closely packed nuclei ending by a somewhat enlarged opening.</p>
    <p class="sp0">(4) The terminal portion, which consists of a thin-walled vesicle.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The last twelve pairs of these organs are all constructed in a very similar manner, while the
  two pairs situated in the fourth and fifth pairs of legs are considerably larger than those
  behind, and are in some respects very differently constituted.</p>

  <p>It will be convenient to commence with one of the hinder nephridia. Such a nephridium from the
  ninth pair of legs is represented in Fig. 11. The external opening is placed at the outer end of a
  transverse groove at the base of one of the legs, while the main portion of the organ lies in the
  body cavity in the base of the leg, and extends into the trunk to about the level <span
  class="pagenum" id="page17"><span class="smaller">{17}</span></span>of the outer edge of the
  nerve-cord of its side. The external opening (<i>o.s</i>) leads into a narrow tube (<i>s.d</i>),
  which gradually dilates into a large sac (<i>s</i>). The narrow part is lined by small epithelial
  cells, which are directly continuous with and perfectly similar to those of the epidermis. The sac
  itself, which forms a kind of bladder or collecting vesicle for the organ, is provided with an
  extremely thin wall, lined with very large flattened cells. The second section of the nephridium
  is formed by the coiled tube, the epithelial lining of which varies slightly in the different
  parts. The third section (<i>s.o.t</i>), constitutes the most distinct portion of the whole organ.
  Its walls are formed of columnar cells almost filled by oval nuclei, which absorb colouring
  matters with very great avidity, and thus render this part extremely conspicuous. The nuclei are
  arranged in several rows. It ends by opening into a vesicle (Fig. 14, D), the wall of which is so
  delicate that it is destroyed when the nephridium is removed from the body, and consequently is
  not shown in Fig. 11.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

  </div>

  <p class="sp3">The fourth and fifth pairs are very considerably larger than those behind, and are
  in other respects peculiar. The great mass of each organ is placed behind the leg on which the
  external opening is placed, immediately outside one of the lateral nerve-cords. The external
  opening, instead of being placed near the base of the leg, is placed on the ventral side of the
  third ring (counting from the outer end) of the thicker portion of the leg. It leads into a
  portion which clearly corresponds with the collecting vesicle of the hinder nephridia. This part
  is not, however, dilated into a vesicle. The three pairs of nephridia in the three foremost pairs
  of legs are rudimentary, consisting solely of a vesicle and duct. The salivary glands are the
  modified nephridia of the segment of the oral papillae.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page18"><span class="smaller">{18}</span></span></div>

  <p class="ac"><b>Generative Organs.</b></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Male.</span>&mdash;The male organs (Fig. 12) consist of a pair of testes
  (<i>te</i>), a pair of vesicles (<i>v</i>), vasa deferentia (<i>v.d</i>), and accessory glandular
  tubules (<i>f</i>). All the above parts lie in the central compartment of the body cavity. In
  <i>P. capensis</i> the accessory glandular bodies or crural glands of the last (17th) pair of legs
  are enlarged and prolonged into an elongated tube placed in the lateral compartment of the body
  cavity (<i>a.g</i>).</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

  <p>The right vas deferens passes under both nerve-cords to join the left, and form the enlarged
  tube (<i>p</i>), which, passing beneath the nerve-cord of its side, runs to the external orifice.
  The enlarged terminal portion possesses thick muscular walls, and possibly constitutes a
  spermatophore maker, as has been shown to be the case in <i>P. N. Zealandiae</i>, by Moseley. In
  some specimens a different arrangement obtains, in that the left vas deferens passes under both
  nerve-cords to join the right.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Female.</span>&mdash;The ovaries consist of a pair of tubes closely applied
  together, and continued posteriorly into the oviducts. The oviducts, after a short course, become
  dilated into the uteruses, which join behind and open to the exterior by a median <span
  class="pagenum" id="page19"><span class="smaller">{19}</span></span>opening. The ovaries always
  contain spermatozoa, some of which project through the ovarian wall into the body cavity.
  Spermatozoa are not found in the uterus and oviducts, and it appears probable that they reach the
  ovary directly by boring through the skin and traversing the body cavity.<a id="NtA_6"
  href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> In the neotropical species there is a globular receptaculum
  seminis opening by two short ducts close together into the oviduct, and there is a small
  receptaculum ovorum with extremely thin walls opening into the oviduct by a short duct just in
  front of the receptaculum seminis. The epithelium of the latter structure is clothed with actively
  moving cilia. In the New Zealand species there is a receptaculum seminis with two ducts, but the
  receptacula ovorum has not been seen.</p>

  <p class="sp3">There appear to be present in most, if not all, the legs some accessory glandular
  structures opening just externally to the nephridia. They are called the crural glands.</p>

  <p class="ac">DEVELOPMENT.</p>

  <p>As stated at the outset, <i>Peripatus</i> is found in three of the great regions, viz. in
  Africa, in Australasia, and in South America and the West Indies. It is a curious and remarkable
  fact that although the species found in these various localities are really closely similar, the
  principal differences relating to the structure of the female generative organs and to the number
  of the legs, they do differ in the most striking manner in the structure of the ovum and in the
  early development. In all the Australasian species the egg is large and heavily charged with
  food-yolk, and is surrounded by a tough membrane. In the Cape species the eggs are smaller, though
  still of considerable size; the yolk is much less developed, and the egg membrane is thinner
  though dense. In the neotropical species the egg is minute and almost entirely devoid of yolk. The
  unsegmented uterine ovum of <i>P. Novae-Zealandiae</i> measures 1.5 mm. in length by .8 mm. in
  breadth; that of <i>P. capensis</i> is .56 mm. in length; and that of <i>P. Trinidadensis</i> .04
  mm. in diameter. In correspondence with these differences in the ovum there are differences in the
  early development, though the later stages are closely similar.</p>

  preceding year are born, and the new ova, which have meanwhile undergone cleavage, pass into the
  uterus. There are ten to twenty ova in each uterus. The segmentation is peculiar, and leads to the
  formation of a solid gastrula, consisting of a cortex of ectoderm nuclei surrounding a central
  endodermal mass, which consists of a much-vacuolated tissue with some irregularly-shaped nuclei.
  The endoderm mass is exposed at one point&mdash;the blastopore (gastrula mouth). The central
  vacuoles of the endoderm now unite and form the enteron of the embryo, and at the same time the
  embryo elongates into a markedly oval form, and an opacity&mdash;the primitive
  streak&mdash;appears at the hind end of the blastopore (Fig. 13, B). This elongation of the embryo
  is accompanied by an elongation of the blastopore, which soon becomes dumb-bell shaped (Fig. 13,
  C). At the same time the mesoblastic somites (embryonic segments of mesoderm) have made <span
  class="pagenum" id="page21"><span class="smaller">{21}</span></span>their appearance in pairs at
  the hind end, and gradually travel forward on each side of the blastopore to the front end, where
  the somites of the anterior pair soon meet in front of the blastopore (Fig. 13, D). Meanwhile the
  narrow middle part of the blastopore has closed by a fusion of its lips, so that the blastopore is
  represented by two openings, the future mouth and anus. A primitive groove makes its appearance
  behind the blastopore (Fig. 13, D). At this stage the hind end of the body becomes curved
  ventrally into a spiral (Fig. 13, E), and at the same time the appendages appear as hollow
  processes of the body wall, a mesoblastic somite being prolonged into each of them. The first to
  appear are the antennae, into which the praeoral somites are prolonged. The remainder appear from
  before backwards in regular order, viz. jaw, oral papillae, legs 1-17. The full number of somites
  and their appendages is not, however, completed until a later stage. The nervous system is formed
  as an annular thickening of ectoderm passing in front of the mouth and behind the anus, and lying
  on each side of the blastopore along the lines of the somites. The praeoral part of this
  thickening, which gives rise to the cerebral ganglia, becomes pitted inwards on each side (Fig.
  13, F, <i>c.g</i>). These pits are eventually closed, and form the hollow ventral appendages of
  the supra-pharyngeal ganglia of the adult (Fig. 9, <i>d</i>). The lips are formed as folds of the
  side wall of the body, extending from the praeoral lobes to just behind the jaw (Fig. 13, F,
  <i>L</i>). They enclose the jaws (<i>j</i>) mouth (<i>M</i>), and opening of the salivary glands
  (<i>o.s</i>), and so give rise to the buccal cavity. The embryo has now lost its spiral curvature,
  and becomes completely doubled upon itself, the hind end being in contact with the mouth (Fig. 13,
  G). It remains in this position until birth. The just-born young are from 10-15 mm. in length and
  have green antennae, but the rest of the body is either quite white or of a reddish colour. This
  red colour differs from the colour of the adult in being soluble in spirit.</p>

  <p>The mesoblastic somites are paired sacs formed from the anterior lateral portions of the
  primitive streak (Fig. 13, C). As they are formed they become placed in pairs on each side of the
  blastopore. The somites of the first pair eventually obtain a position entirely in front of the
  blastopore (Fig. 13, D). They form the somites of the praeoral lobes. The full complement of
  somites is acquired at about the stage of Fig. 13, E.</p>

      stages. (After Sedgwick.) <b>A</b>, Early stage: 1, gut; 2, mesoblastic somite; no trace of
      the vascular space; endoderm and ectoderm in contact. <b>B</b>, Endoderm has separated from
      the dorsal and ventral ectoderm. The somite is represented as having divided on the left side
      into a dorsal and ventral portion: 1, gut; 2, somite; 3, haemocoele. <b>C</b>, The haemocoele
      (3) has become divided up into a number of spaces, the arrangement of which is unimportant.
      The dorsal part of each somite has travelled dorsalwards, and now constitutes a small space
      (triangular in section) just dorsal to the gut. The ventral portion (2&prime;) has assumed a
      tubular character, and has acquired an external opening. The internal vesicle is already
      indicated, and is shown in the diagram by the thinner black line: 1, gut; 2&prime;, nephridial
      part of coelom; 3, haemocoele; 3&prime;, part of haemocoele which will form the

  </div>

  <p class="sp3">The relations of the somites is shown in Fig. 14, A, which represents a transverse
  section taken between the mouth and anus of an embryo of the stage of Fig. 13, D. The history of
  these somites is an exceedingly interesting one, and may be described shortly as
  follows:&mdash;They divide into two parts&mdash;a ventral part, which extends into the appendage,
  and a dorsal part (Fig. 14, B). The ventral part acquires an opening to the exterior just outside
  the nerve-cord, and becomes entirely transformed into a nephridium (Fig. 14, D, 2&prime;). The
  dorsal part shifts dorsalwards and diminishes relatively in size (Fig. 14, C). Its fate differs in
  the different parts <span class="pagenum" id="page23"><span class="smaller">{23}</span></span>of
  the body. In the anterior somites it dwindles and disappears, but in the posterior part it unites
  with the dorsal divisions of contiguous somites of the same side, and forms a tube&mdash;the
  generative tube (Fig. 14, D, 2). The last section of this tube retains its connexion with the
  ventral portion of the somite, and so acquires an external opening, which is at first lateral, but
  soon shifts to the middle line, and fuses with its fellow, to form the single generative opening.
  The praeoral somite develops the rudiment of a nephridium, but eventually entirely disappears. The
  jaw somite also disappears; the oral papilla somite forms ventrally the salivary glands, which are
  thus serially homologous with nephridia. The perivisceral cavity of <i>Peripatus</i> is, as in all
  Arthropoda, a haemocoele. Its various divisions develop as a series of spaces between the ectoderm
  and endoderm, and later in the mesoderm. The mesoderm seems to be formed entirely from the
  proliferation of the cells of the mesoblastic somites. It thus appears that in <i>Peripatus</i>
  the coelom does not develop a perivisceral portion, but gives rise only to the renal and
  reproductive organs.</p>

  <p><i>Tracheata</i> with separated head and numerous, fairly similar segments. They have one pair
  of antennae, two or three pairs of mouth appendages, and numerous pairs of legs.</p>

  <p>The Myriapoda are a class of animals which are widely distributed, and are represented in
  almost every part of the globe. Heat and cold alike seem to offer favourable conditions for their
  existence, and they flourish both in the most fertile and the most barren countries.</p>

  <p>They have not attracted much notice until comparatively recent times. Compared with Insects
  they have been but little known. The reason of this is not hard to find. The Myriapods do not
  exercise so much direct influence on human affairs as do some other classes of animals; for
  instance, Insects. They include no species which is of direct use to man, like the silkworm or the
  cochineal insect, and they are of no use to him as food. It is true that they are injurious to his
  crops. For instance, the species of Millepede known as the "wire worm"<a id="NtA_10"
  href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> is extremely harmful; but this has only attracted much notice in
  modern times, when land is of more value than formerly, and agriculture is pursued in a more
  scientific manner, and the constant endeavour to get the utmost amount of crop from the soil has
  caused a minute investigation into the various species of animals which are noxious to the growing
  crop. The species of <span class="pagenum" id="page30"><span
  class="smaller">{30}</span></span>Myriapoda best known to the ancients were those which were
  harmful to man on account of their poisonous bite.</p>

  <p>Some writers have supposed that the word which is translated "mole" in the Bible (Lev. xi. 30)
  is really <i>Scolopendra</i> (a genus of Centipede), and, if this is so, it is the earliest
  mention of the Myriapods. They were rarely noticed in the classical times; almost the only mention
  of them is by &AElig;lian, who says that the whole population of a town called Rhetium were driven out
  by a swarm of Scolopendras. Pliny tells us of a marine Scolopendra, but this was most probably a
  species of marine worm.</p>

  <p>Linnaeus included Myriapods among the Insects; and the writers after him till the beginning of
  this century classed them with all sorts of Insects, with Spiders, Scorpions, and even among
  Serpents. It was Leach who first raised them to the importance of a separate class, and Latreille
  first gave them the name of Myriapoda, which they have retained ever since.</p>

  <p>Myriapods are terrestrial animals, crawling or creeping on the ground or on logs of wood, or
  even under the bark of trees. There is, however, a partial exception to this; various naturalists
  have from time to time given descriptions of marine Centipedes. These are not found in the sea,
  but crawl about on the shore, where they are submerged by each tide. Professor F. Plateau has
  given an account of the two species of Myriapods that are found thus living a semi-aquatic life.
  They are named <i>Geophilus maritimus</i> and <i>Geophilus submarinus</i>, and Plateau found that
  they could exist in sea water from twelve to seventy hours, and in fresh water from six to ten
  days. They thus offer a striking example of the power that their class possess of existing under
  unfavourable circumstances.</p>

  <p>With regard to their habits the different species differ very considerably. On the one hand we
  have the Chilopoda, or Centipedes, as they are called in this country, active, swift, and
  ferocious; living for the most part in dark and obscure places, beneath stones, logs of wood, and
  dried leaves, etc., and feeding on living animals. On the other hand, we have the Chilognatha, or
  Millepedes, distinguished by their slow movements and vegetable diet; inoffensive to man, except
  by the destruction they occasion to his crops, and having as a means of defence no formidable
  weapon like the large poison claws of the Centipedes, but only a peculiarly offensive liquid
  secreted by special glands <span class="pagenum" id="page31"><span
  class="smaller">{31}</span></span>known by the unpleasant though expressive name of "stink
  glands," or by the more euphonious Latin name of <i>glandulae odoriferae</i>.</p>

  <p>As a general rule the larger species of Myriapods are found in the hotter climates, some of the
  tropical species being very large, and some, among the family of the Scolopendridae, extremely
  poisonous; and it is even said that their bite is fatal to man.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>If, however, the Centipede is sometimes fatal to man, it does not always have it its own way,
  for we read of man making food of Centipedes. It is hard to believe that any human being could
  under any circumstances eat Centipedes, which have been described by one naturalist as "a
  disgusting tribe loving the darkness." Nevertheless, Humboldt informs us that he has seen the
  Indian children drag out of the earth Centipedes eighteen inches long and more than half an inch
  wide and devour them.</p>

  </div>

  <p>This, I believe, is the only account of human beings using the Myriapoda as food, if we except
  the accounts of the religious fanatics among the African Arabs, who are said to devour Centipedes
  alive; though this is not a case of eating for pleasure, for the Scolopendras are devoured in
  company with leaves of the prickly pear, broken glass, etc., as a test of the unpleasant things
  which may be eaten under the influence of religious excitement.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page32"><span class="smaller">{32}</span></span></div>

  <p>A cold climate, however, is not fatal to some fairly large species of Centipedes. A striking
  instance of this came under my own observation some years ago. In 1886 I was travelling in the
  island of Cyprus&mdash;the "Enchanted Island," as Mr. Mallock calls it in his book written about
  the same time&mdash;with the intention of observing its natural history. This island consists of a
  broad flat country crossed by two mountain ranges of considerable height, thus offering the
  contrast of a hot climate in the plains and a cold climate in the mountains. On the plain country
  I found among the Myriapoda that the most common species were a large <i>Scolopendra</i> and a
  large <i>Lithobius</i>. The <i>Scolopendra</i> was fairly common, living for the most part under
  large stones, and it was a pleasant task to search for them in a ruined garden near Larnaca.</p>

  <p>This garden was made for the public, and is situated about a quarter of a mile from the old
  town of Larnaca. It has been suffered to fall into decay, and is now quite neglected. Mr. Mallock
  has described many beautiful scenes in his book, but I think he could have found few more
  beautiful than this old garden with its deserted gardener's house, now a heap of ruins, but
  overgrown with masses of luxuriant vegetation, with beautiful flowers peeping out here and there
  as if charitably endeavouring to hide the negligence of man, and to turn the desolation into a
  scene of beauty. I got several prizes in this garden, but found the Myriapods were principally
  represented by the species I have mentioned.</p>

  <p>After leaving Larnaca I rode across the plain country through blazing heat, which was rapidly
  parching up the ground to a uniform brown colour. At every stopping-place I found the same species
  of <i>Scolopendra</i> and of <i>Lithobius</i>. After a few days I began to get up among the
  mountains of the northern range, and the burning heat of the treeless plain was gradually
  exchanged for the cool shade of the pine-trees and the fresh air of the mountains. As I ascended
  higher and higher the temperature grew cooler till I reached the top of Mount Troodos, the ancient
  Olympus. Here in the month of May the snow still lingered in white patches, and the air was clear
  and cold. I remained on the top of Troodos for a week, while I made a close examination of the
  fauna to be found there. I was much surprised to find the identical species of <i>Scolopendra</i>
  and <span class="pagenum" id="page33"><span class="smaller">{33}</span></span><i>Lithobius</i>
  with which I had become acquainted in the heat of the low country, quite at home among the snow,
  and as common as in, what I should have imagined to be, the more congenial climate. Nor were they
  any the less lively. Far from exhibiting any sort of torpor from the cold, the first one which I
  triumphantly seized in my forceps wriggled himself loose and fastened on my finger with a vigour
  which made me as anxious to get rid of him as I had formerly been to secure him. However, he
  eventually went into my collecting box.</p>

  <p>On the whole, we may say that the Chilopoda are most largely represented in the hotter
  climates, where they find a more abundant diet in the rich insect life of the tropical and
  semi-tropical countries. The more brightly-coloured Myriapods, too, are for the most part
  inhabitants of the warmer countries. The ease with which they are introduced into a country in the
  earth round plants, and in boxes of fruit, may account to a great extent for the wide distribution
  of the various species in different countries. Mr. Pocock, who examined the Myriapods brought back
  from the "Challenger" Expedition, informs us that of ten species brought from Bermuda, four had
  been introduced from the West Indies. There is no doubt that animals which can bear changes of
  temperature and deprivation of food, and even a short immersion in the water, are well calculated
  to be introduced into strange countries in many unexpected ways.</p>

  <p>As might be expected from a class of animals so widely distributed, Myriapods show an almost
  infinite variety of size and colour. We find them so small that we can hardly see them with the
  naked eye, as in the case of the tiny <i>Polyxenus</i>, the Pauropidae, and the Scolopendrellidae.
  We also find them more than six inches in length, as the larger species of Scolopendridae. I am
  afraid we must dismiss as an exaggeration an account of Centipedes in Carthagena a yard in length,
  and more than six inches in breadth. The giver of this account&mdash;Ulloa&mdash;informs us that
  the bite of this gigantic serpent-like creature is mortal if a timely remedy be not applied. It is
  certainly extremely probable that the bite of a Centipede of this size would be fatal to any one.
  Some Centipedes are short and broad, and composed of few segments, as <i>Glomeris</i>; some are
  long and thin, with more than a hundred segments, as <i>Geophilus</i>. They may be beautifully
  coloured with brilliant streaks of colour, as in some <span class="pagenum" id="page34"><span
  class="smaller">{34}</span></span>of the Julidae or Polydesmidae, or may be of a dull and rusty
  iron colour, or quite black.</p>

  <p>One of the strangest peculiarities found among Myriapods is that some of them (e.g.
  <i>Geophilus electricus</i>) are phosphorescent. As I was walking one summer evening near my home
  in Cambridgeshire I saw what I thought was a match burning. Looking more closely, I saw it move,
  and thinking it was a glow-worm I picked it up, and was surprised to find that it was a
  <i>Geophilus</i> shining with a brilliant phosphorescent light. I let it crawl over my hand, and
  it left a bright trail of light behind it, which lasted some time. I have been told that this
  species is common in Epping Forest; also in Cambridgeshire.<a id="NtA_11"
  href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Besides <i>G. electricus</i>, <i>G. phosphoreus</i> has been described as a luminous species by
  Linnaeus, on the authority of a Swedish sea captain, who asserted that it dropped from the air,
  shining like a glow-worm, upon his ship when he was sailing in the Indian Ocean a hundred miles
  from land.</p>

  <p>What the use of this phosphorescence may be is not known with any degree of certainty. It may
  be either a defence against enemies, or else a means of attracting the two sexes to one
  another.</p>

  <p>The places which the Myriapods select for their habitation vary as much as their colour and
  size, though, with a few exceptions, they chose dark and obscure places. A curious species of
  Myriapod is <i>Pseudotremia cavernarum</i> (Cope), which is found in certain caves in America. The
  peculiar life it leads in these caves seems to have a great influence on its colour, and also
  affects the development of its eyes. Mr. Packard's account of them is worth quoting: "Four
  specimens which I collected in Little Wyandotte cave were exactly the same size as those from
  Great Wyandotte cave. They were white tinged, dusky on the head and fore part of the body. The
  eyes are black and the eye-patch of the same size and shape, while the antennae are the same.</p>

  <p>"Six specimens from Bradford cave, Ind. (which is a small grotto formed by a vertical fissure
  in the rock, and only 300 to 400 yards deep), showed more variation than those from the two
  Wyandotte caves. They are of the same size and form, but slightly longer and a little
  slenderer.... The antennae are much whiter than in those from the Wyandotte caves, and the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page35"><span class="smaller">{35}</span></span>head and body are paler, more
  bleached out than most of the Wyandotte specimens.... It thus appears that the body is most
  bleached and the eyes the most rudimentary in the Bradford cave, the smallest and most accessible,
  and in which consequently there is the most variation in surroundings, temperature, access of
  light and changed condition of air. Under such circumstances as these we should naturally expect
  the most variation."<a id="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A strong contrast to these animals is afforded us by the Scutigeridae (Schizotarsia). They are
  unknown in this country, but abound in some of the Mediterranean countries and in parts of Africa.
  They remind one strongly of spiders, with their long legs and their peculiar way of running on
  stones and about the walls of houses.</p>

      (From C. L. Koch, <i>Die Myriapoden</i>.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Some years ago I was in Malta, and I used to go and watch them on the slopes outside Valetta,
  where they were to be found in great numbers. They used to come out from beneath great stones and
  run about rapidly on the ground or on the stones and rubbish with which the ground was covered,
  now and again making a dart at some small insect which tempted them, and seemingly not minding the
  blazing sun at all. As might be expected from their habits, their eyes, far from being
  rudimentary, like those of the cave-living <i>Pseudotremia</i>, or absent <span class="pagenum"
  id="page36"><span class="smaller">{36}</span></span>like those of the Polydesmidae, or of our own
  <i>Cryptops</i>, are highly developed, and form the only example among the Myriapods of what are
  known as facetted eyes. The Scutigeridae are also remarkable among Myriapods for the possession of
  a peculiar sense-organ which is found in no other Myriapod.</p>

  <p>The Myriapods most numerous in our own country are <i>Lithobius</i> and <i>Julus</i>.
  <i>Lithobius</i>, which will be described later on, may be found in almost any garden under dried
  leaves, stones, etc. <i>Julus</i>, the common wire-worm, is found crawling on plants and leaves
  and under the bark of trees, and does a good deal of damage in a garden. <i>Polydesmus</i> is also
  frequently found in great numbers, and usually a great many of them together. <i>Glomeris</i> is
  also found, though it is not so common as the first two mentioned animals. <i>Geophilus</i> is
  also common, and especially in the south of England. Scolopendridae are only represented by a
  single genus, <i>Cryptops</i>, which is not very common, though by no means rare. The best place
  to find them is in manure heaps. The animals of this species are small compared to most
  Scolopendras, and have the peculiarity of being without any eyes.</p>

  <p><i>Scutigera</i> is unrepresented in this country. One was found in Scotland some years ago by
  Mr. Gibson Carmichael, but was shown to have been imported, and not bred in the place.</p>

  <p>The means of defence possessed by these animals also differ very much in the different species
  of Myriapods. In the Centipedes the animals are provided with a powerful weapon in the great
  poison claws which lie just beneath the mouth, and which are provided with large poison glands,
  which supply a fluid which runs through a canal in the hard substance of the claw and passes into
  the wound made by the latter. The effect of this fluid is instantaneous on the small animals which
  form the food of the Centipedes. I have myself watched <i>Lithobius</i> in this country creep up
  to a blue-bottle fly and seize it between the poison claws. One powerful nip and the blue-bottle
  was dead, as if struck by lightning. I have also seen them kill worms and also other
  <i>Lithobius</i> in the same way. When another <i>Lithobius</i> is wounded by the poison claws it
  seems to be paralysed behind the wound. The Millepedes, on the other hand, have no such offensive
  and defensive weapon. They rely for protection on the fluid secreted by the <i>stigmata
  repugnatoria</i> (or <i>glandulae odoriferae</i>) mentioned before. This fluid has been shown to
  contain prussic acid, and has a very unpleasant odour.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page37"><span class="smaller">{37}</span></span></div>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">
    <a href="images/fig18.jpg"><img style="width:20%" src="images/fig18.jpg" alt="fig18"

    <div class="smaller ac">
      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 18.</span>&mdash;<i>Polyxenus lagurus</i> (From C. L.
      Koch, <i>Die Myriapoden</i>).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Most of the Millepedes are provided with these glands; but in the cave Myriapods mentioned
  before, the animals have not to contend against so many adversaries, and these glands almost
  disappear. Other Myriapods defend themselves by means of the long and stiff bristles with which
  they are provided, <i>e.g.</i> the little <i>Polyxenus</i>. This means of defence seems to have
  been more common among the fossil Myriapods than among those still living. Variations in the shape
  and size of the limbs are numerous, as might be expected in so large a class of animals. One of
  the most curious of such variations is found in a Centipede of the Scolopendra tribe, called
  <i>Eucorybas</i>, in which the last limbs are flattened out and provided with paddle-shaped lobes.
  The use of these is unknown, but it is probable that they are concerned in some way with the
  breeding habits of the animal. The habits of the Myriapods connected with their breeding are most
  interesting, but have been very insufficiently investigated. There is no doubt that a full inquiry
  into all such habits would be of great interest, and would help to answer some of the problems
  which are still unsolved in these forms. My own observations refer to two forms&mdash;<i>Julus
  terrestris</i> among the Millepedes, and <i>Lithobius forficatus</i> among the Centipedes.
  <i>Julus terrestris</i> is one of the most common of the English Millepedes, and can be easily
  obtained. I kept them in large shallow glass vessels with a layer of earth at the bottom, and thus
  was able easily to watch the whole process. They breed in the months of May, June, and July. The
  female <i>Julus</i> when about to lay her eggs sets to work to form a kind of nest or receptacle
  for her eggs. She burrows down into the earth, and at some distance below the surface begins the
  work. She moistens small bits of earth with the sticky fluid secreted by her salivary glands,
  which become extraordinarily active in the spring. She works up these bits of earth with her jaws
  and front legs till they are of a convenient size and shape, and places them together. When
  complete, the nest is shaped like a hollow sphere, the inside being smooth and even, while the
  outside is rough and shows the shape of the small knobs of earth of which it is composed. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page38"><span class="smaller">{38}</span></span>She leaves a small opening in
  the top. The size of the whole nest is about that of a small nut. When she is ready to lay her
  eggs she passes them through the hole in the top, and usually lays about 60 to 100 eggs at a time.
  The eggs, which are very small, are coated with a glutinous fluid which causes them to adhere
  together. When they are all laid she closes up the aperture with a piece of earth moistened with
  her saliva; and having thus hermetically sealed the nest, she leaves the whole to its fate. The
  eggs hatch in about twelve days.</p>

  <p>A naturalist named Verloef has lately found that the males of some Julidae undergo certain
  changes in the form of the legs and other organs in autumn and spring. These changes are probably
  connected with the breeding of the animal, and remind us of the changes undergone during the
  breeding season by salmon among the fishes.</p>

  <p><i>Julus</i> breed very readily if carefully attended to and well supplied with food. If they
  cannot obtain the food they like they will not breed so well. I found that sliced apples with
  leaves and grass formed the best food for them.</p>

  <p>The process in the case of <i>Lithobius</i> is much harder to watch. <i>Lithobius</i> is not so
  plentiful as <i>Julus terrestris</i>, and the animals are more impatient of captivity, more shy in
  their habits, and do not breed so readily.</p>

  <p>In January 1889 I was given the use of a room in the New Museums at Cambridge, and was allowed
  to fit it up as I liked, so that I was able to try the effect of different degrees of light and
  darkness, and of different degrees of warmth. I succeeded in observing the whole process. The
  female <i>Lithobius</i> is furnished with two small movable hooks at the end of the under surface
  of the body close to the opening of the oviduct. These small hooks have been observed by many
  naturalists, but their use has, so far as I know, never been described before. They play an
  important part in the proceedings following the laying of the egg. The time of breeding in
  <i>Lithobius</i> is rather later than in <i>Julus</i>, and begins about June and continues till
  August. There are first of all some convulsive movements of the last segments of the body, and
  then in about ten minutes the egg appears at the entrance of the oviduct. The egg is a small
  sphere (about the size of a number five shot), rather larger than that of <i>Julus</i>, and is
  covered with a sticky slime <span class="pagenum" id="page39"><span
  class="smaller">{39}</span></span>secreted by the large glands inside the body, usually called the
  accessory glands. When the egg falls out it is received by the little hooks, and is firmly clasped
  by them. This is the critical moment in the existence of the <i>Lithobius</i> into which the egg
  is destined to develop. If a male <i>Lithobius</i> sees the egg he makes a rush at the female,
  seizes the egg, and at once devours it. All the subsequent proceedings of the female seem to be
  directed to the frustration of this act of cannibalism. As soon as the egg is firmly clasped in
  the little hooks she rushes off to a convenient place away from the male, and uses her hooks to
  roll the egg round and round until it is completely covered by earth, which sticks to it owing to
  the viscous material with which it is coated; she also employs her hind legs, which have glands on
  the thighs, to effect her purpose. When the operation is complete the egg resembles a small round
  ball of mud, and is indistinguishable from the surrounding soil. It is thus safe from the
  voracious appetite of the male, and she leaves it to its fate. The number of eggs laid is small
  when compared with the number laid by <i>Julus</i>.</p>

  <p>The food in the case of <i>Lithobius</i> consisted of worms and blue-bottles, which were put
  alive into the glass vessel containing the <i>Lithobius</i>. I tried raw meat chopped up, but they
  did not thrive on it in the same way that they did on the living animals. I also put into their
  vessel bits of rotten wood containing larvae of insects, etc.</p>

  <p>I have succeeded in bringing back some specimens of <i>Polydesmus</i> alive from Madeira, and
  in getting them to breed in this country&mdash;of course in artificial warmth&mdash;and their way
  of laying eggs and making a nest resembles that of <i>Julus</i>. <i>Geophilus</i> has one curious
  habit in connexion with the fertilisation of the female. The male spins a web and deposits in the
  middle of it a single spermatophore, and the female comes to the web to be fertilised. The
  Scolopendridae are said to bring forth their young alive, but I think the evidence for this is
  unsatisfactory. What have been taken for the young Scolopendrae are perhaps the large
  spermatophores of the male, which are not unlike a larval Myriapod in size and shape. I have never
  been able to observe the process of breeding in this family. I have had the spermatophores sent me
  from Gibraltar as "eggs," but a little examination soon showed me their real character.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page40"><span class="smaller">{40}</span></span></div>

  <p>The mode of progression in the Myriapods differs considerably, as might be expected in a class
  in which the number of legs varies to such an extent. The swiftest among them are the Scutigeridae
  with their long spider-like legs. The Scolopendridae are also able to move with considerable
  rapidity, and are also able to move tail forward almost as well as in the ordinary manner. Where
  there are such a number of legs it becomes a curious question as to the order in which the animal
  moves them; and though several people have endeavoured to find this out, the number of legs to be
  moved and the rapid movements have rendered accurate observation impossible.</p>

  <p>Some years ago Professor E. Ray Lankester tried to study the order in which the legs of
  Centipedes moved, and came to the conclusion (recorded in an amusing letter in <i>Nature</i>, 23rd
  May 1889) that if the animal had to study the question itself, it would not get on at all. He
  finishes his letter with the following verses<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>A Centipede was happy quite</p>
    <p>Until a toad in fun</p>
    <p>Said, "Pray which leg moves after which?"</p>
    <p>This raised her doubts to such a pitch,</p>
    <p>She fell exhausted in the ditch,</p>
    <p>Not knowing how to run.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The progression of Millepedes is much slower than that of the Centipedes, and it is remarkable
  that when the animal is in motion a sort of wave runs down the long fringe-like row of feet. I
  have endeavoured to make out this motion, but have never been able to understand it
  satisfactorily. My belief was that the feet were moved in sets of five.</p>

  <p>This wave-like peculiarity of motion is described in a curious old book, <i>An Essay towards a
  Natural History of Serpents</i>. Charles Owen, D.D. London, 1742: "The Ambua, so the natives of
  Brazil call the Millepedes and the Centipedes, are serpents. Those reptiles of thousand legs bend
  as they crawl along, and are reckoned very poisonous. In these Multipedes the mechanism of the
  body is very curious; in their going it is observable that on each side of their bodies every leg
  has its motion, one regularly after another, so that their legs, being numerous, form a kind of
  undulation, and thereby communicate to the body a swifter progression than one could imagine where
  <span class="pagenum" id="page41"><span class="smaller">{41}</span></span>so many short feet are
  to take so many short steps, that follow one another rolling on like the waves of the sea."</p>

  <p>Before proceeding to the classification of Myriapods, which will form the next part of this
  account, a few words on the common names for them may not be without interest.</p>

  <p>In English we have the names Centipede and Millepede, and the Continental nations have similar
  names implying the possession of a hundred or a thousand legs, as the German "Tausendf&uuml;sse" and
  the French "Millepieds." Of course these are general words, simply implying the possession of a
  great number of legs. But we have also among the peasantry a name for Centipedes which conveys a
  much more accurate idea of the number. The people of the eastern counties (I daresay the term is
  more widely spread) call them "forty legs." This is not quite accurate, but as <i>Lithobius</i>
  has 17 legs on each side, and <i>Scolopendra</i> (<i>Cryptops</i> is the English species) has 21
  on each side, it is a better approximation than Centipede. But another country has a still more
  accurate term. I found some <i>Scolopendra</i> in Beyrout, and asked my native servant what he
  called them. He gave them what I afterwards found was the common Arab name for them, "&lsquo;arba
  w&aacute;l &lsquo;arbarin," forty-four legs. Now the Scolopendras, which in hotter climates are the chief
  representatives of the Centipedes, have actually forty-two legs, or, if the poison claws are
  counted, forty-four. In looking up the Arab term for Centipede I came across a curious description
  given of them by Avicenna, the great Arabian physician: "This is an animal known for its habit of
  going into ears. For the most part it is a palm's length" [about four inches, which is the average
  length of many species]. "On each side of the body it has twenty-two feet, and moves equally well
  either backwards or forwards."</p>

  <p>With regard to its alleged habit of going into ears, the learned Arabian has evidently made a
  false imputation on the character of our animal, and has probably relied too much on the stories
  told him. He has also exaggerated in stating that it goes equally well either backwards or
  forwards. Some Centipedes can go backwards very easily and well, though not so well as forwards.
  Perhaps he preferred examining dead specimens, which afford an easy opportunity of counting their
  legs, to experimenting with living animals, which might have resented liberties taken with
  them.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page42"><span class="smaller">{42}</span></span></div>

  <p class="sp3">The Persians have several words for them, less accurate than the Arabs and more
  like our own terms. For instance, they call them "Hazarpa," or thousand feet, like our Millepedes;
  also "Sadpa," or hundred feet, equivalent to our Centipedes. Another term resembles our common
  term before mentioned, "Chehlpa," forty feet. A more figurative term is "tasbih dud," a worm
  resembling a rosary with a hundred beads; this word is translated in Richardson's Persian
  Dictionary as "a venomous insect having eight feet and a piked tail."</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Classification of the Myriapoda.</b></p>

  <p>Two of the principal writers on the classification of the Myriapods are Koch and Latzel, both
  of whom have classified the whole group. I do not wish for a moment to undervalue the many authors
  who have done excellent work on the classification of different groups and families, but I wish
  here to give an outline of a classification of the whole class, and I naturally have recourse to
  the authors who have treated the subject as a whole.</p>

  <p>Koch's two works, the <i>System der Myriapoden</i><a id="NtA_13"
  href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> and <i>Die Myriapoden</i>,<a id="NtA_14"
  href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> cover the whole range of the class, and his divisions are
  clearly marked out and are easily understood, but both works are comparatively old. He does not
  include the Scolopendrellidae or the Pauropidae, which are now included by all naturalists in the
  Myriapoda. Latzel is a more recent writer, and though his work is entitled <i>The Myriapods of the
  Austro-Hungarian Empire</i>,<a id="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> he gives much
  information about Myriapods not found in Europe, and his work is fairly entitled to be considered
  as embracing the whole class. He divides the Myriapods into four Orders, including the
  Scolopendrellidae and Pauropidae. On the whole, I think it will be better here to take the
  classification of Koch, and to add to it the two Orders before mentioned, viz. Symphyla containing
  one family the Scolopendrellidae, and Pauropoda with one family the Pauropidae.</p>

  <p>The Orders are as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page43"><span class="smaller">{43}</span></span></div>

  <p class="ac">Order I. <span class="sc">Chilognatha</span> (= <span

  rings with two pairs of legs to each. Genital organs opening ventrally on the anterior rings of
  the posterior part of the body, <i>i.e.</i> on one of the anterior of the segments bearing two
  pairs of legs; usually the 7th.</p>

  <p>This Order is divided into eight families:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>The Structure of the Myriapoda.</b></p>

  <p>Having now given a short view of the classification of the Class, I will proceed to give a
  general account of their structure, the variations in which have led to the divisions into the
  various Orders and Families. Their structure shows resemblances to several widely different
  classes of animals. One cannot help being impressed with their likeness to the Worms, at the same
  time they have affinities with the Crustaceans, and still more with the Insects. In the latter
  class the likeness of the Thysanuridae to <i>Scolopendrella</i> and <i>Pauropus</i> have induced a
  celebrated Italian anatomist, Professor Grassi, to claim the former as the ancestors of the
  Myriapoda.</p>

  <p>Myriapods have a body which is segmented, as it is termed; that is, composed of a number of
  more or less similar parts or segments joined together.</p>

  <p>One of the most important characteristics which distinguish Myriapods from other Arthropoda is
  the fact that they possess on the posterior segments of the body true legs which are jointed and
  take part in locomotion. The head is in all cases quite distinct from the body, and may be
  regarded as a number of segments fused together into one mass. Their heads are always provided
  with a single pair of <i>antennae</i> and mouth appendages, consisting of an upper lip, a pair of
  <i>mandibles</i> or jaws, and one to two pairs of <i>maxillae</i>. The mandibles resemble those of
  Insects, and are strongly toothed. In the Chilognatha a pair of maxillae are fused so as to form a
  single oval appendage. In the Chilopoda they each consist of a single blade bearing a <span
  class="pagenum" id="page48"><span class="smaller">{48}</span></span>short palp or feeler. The
  mouth parts may have the forms known as chewing, biting, or suctorial (<i>Polyzonium</i>) mouth
  appendages.</p>

  <p>With the exception of the terminal segment, and in many cases the first or the seventh, each
  segment bears one or two pairs of limbs. These may be very long, as in <i>Scutigera</i>, or very
  short, as in <i>Polyxenus</i>. They may be attached close to one another near the ventral middle
  line of the body, or may have their bases far apart from each other, as in the Chilopoda. The
  exoskeleton or external armour is composed of chitin (Chilopoda) or of chitin with calcareous
  salts deposited in it (Chilognatha).</p>

  <p>Their internal structure has a great likeness to that of Insects.</p>

  <p>The general position of the internal organs may be seen from Fig. 28, which shows a
  <i>Lithobius</i> dissected so as to exhibit the digestive and nervous systems.</p>

  <p><i>The digestive canal</i>, which is a straight tube, extends throughout the whole length of
  the body, and terminates in the last segment of the body. It may be divided into the following
  parts<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="fine sp2">
    <p>1. A narrow oesophagus, beginning with the mouth or buccal cavity, and receiving the contents
    of two or more salivary glands (<i>d</i>).</p>
    <p>2. A wide mesenteron or mid-gut (<i>n</i>) extending throughout almost the whole length of
    the body.</p>
    <p class="sp0">3. A rectum which at its junction with the mid-gut receives the contents of two
    or four <i>Malpighian tubes</i> (<i>g</i>, <i>h</i>) which function as kidneys.  Their function
    was for a long time unknown, but the discovery of crystals of uric acid in them placed the
    matter beyond doubt.</p>
  </div>

  <p><i>The heart</i> has the form of a long pulsating dorsal vessel which extends through the whole
  length of the animal.  It is divided into a number of chambers, which are attached to the dorsal
  wall of the body, and are furnished with muscles of a wing-like shape, which are known as the
  alary muscles, and which govern its pulsations.  The chambers are furnished with valves and
  arteries for the exit of the blood, and slits known as <i>ostia</i> for the return of the blood to
  the heart.  The blood enters the chambers of the heart from the body cavity through the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page49"><span class="smaller">{49}</span></span>ostia, and passes out through
  the arteries to circulate through the organs of the body and to return by the ostia.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

  </div>

  <p>The two figures below (Figs. 29 and 30) show the position of the arteries and the ostia in a
  single segment of the body. The heart is too small and delicate to be seen with the naked eye; it
  therefore requires the aid of the microscope. A freshly-killed animal was therefore taken and
  prepared in the manner known to all microscopists, and extremely thin slices or sections cut
  horizontally from its back. One of these sections cut the whole length of the heart in one
  segment, which was accordingly drawn under the microscope (Fig. 29), and shows a longitudinal
  <span class="pagenum" id="page50"><span class="smaller">{50}</span></span>horizontal section
  through the whole length of the heart in a single segment, with the two ostia at each end of the
  segment and the two arteries in the middle.</p>

  <p>The arteries, when they leave the body, pass into masses of fatty tissue on either side of the
  heart, and the other figure (Fig. 30) is intended to show the artery leaving the heart and
  penetrating into the fatty tissue. The figure is taken from the same section as the former one,
  but is much more highly magnified, so as to show more detail. The delicate coats of the heart are
  shown, the artery being covered with a clothing of large cells.</p>

  <p>Myriapods breathe by means of <i>tracheae</i>, with the exception of the Scutigeridae, which
  have an elementary form of lung which resembles that of spiders, and will be mentioned further on.
  These tracheae, as in Insects, are tubes lined with chitin, which is arranged in spiral bands. The
  tracheae open to the exterior by openings called <i>stigmata</i>, through which they receive the
  external air, which passes into the main tracheal tubes and into their ramifications, and thus
  effects the aeration of the blood.</p>

  <p>The <i>nervous system</i> of the Myriapods consists, as in Insects, of a brain, which may be
  more or less developed, a circumoesophageal ring embracing the oesophagus, and a ventral chain of
  ganglia, and in some cases (Newport) of a system of visceral <span class="pagenum"
  id="page51"><span class="smaller">{51}</span></span>nerves. With the nervous system we may mention
  the sense organs, the eyes, which are present in most cases, though wanting, as has been already
  stated, in many groups. They are usually present as clusters of ocelli or eye spots closely packed
  together, or (in <i>Scutigera</i>) as peculiarly formed facetted eyes. The sensory hairs on the
  antennae must be reckoned as sense organs, as also the tufts of sense hairs on the head of
  <i>Polyxenus</i>. <i>Scutigera</i> has also a peculiar sense organ beneath the head, consisting of
  a sac opening on the under side of the head full of slender hairs, each of which is connected at
  its base with a nerve fibre. Except the eyes, the Myriapod sense organs have usually the form of
  hairs or groups of hairs connected with nerve fibres, which communicate with the central nervous
  system.</p>

  part of a section through the head of <i>Polyxenus</i> with two of the sense hairs. Each spine or
  sense hair fits into a cup in the chitin of the head; and the lower or internal part, which is
  divided from the upper or external part by a rim, is joined to a ganglionic nerve cell
  (<i>gang.c.</i>).</p>

  <p>The Myriapods are of separate sexes, and the generative organs in both cases usually have the
  form of a long unpaired <span class="pagenum" id="page52"><span
  class="smaller">{52}</span></span>tube, which in the male is connected with accessory glands, and
  in the female is usually provided with double receptacula seminis. The generative openings usually
  lie near the base of the second pair of legs (Chilognatha), or at the posterior end of the body
  (Chilopoda). In the Chilognatha there is usually in the male an external copulatory organ at the
  base of the seventh pair of legs, remote from the genital opening.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The preceding account of the anatomy of the Myriapods has shown us the general
  characteristics of the whole group. I shall now take each of the five Orders into which the class
  is divided in the classification adopted in this account, and endeavour to explain the differences
  in anatomy which have led to the establishment of the Order. The first Order with which we have to
  do is that of the Chilognatha, which includes a large number of Myriapods; no less than eight
  families, some of them including a great number of forms.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order I. Chilognatha.</b></p>

  <p>The Chilognatha differ from other Orders in the shape of the body. This is in almost all cases,
  cylindrical or sub-cylindrical, instead of being more or less flattened as in the other
  Orders.</p>

  <p>The body, as in all other Myriapods, is composed of segments, but in the Chilognatha these
  segments are composed, in almost all cases, of a complete ring of the substance of which the
  exoskeleton (as the shell of the animal is called) is composed. This substance is in the case of
  the Chilognatha chitin (a kind of horny substance, resembling, for instance, the outer case of a
  beetle's wing), containing a quantity of chalk salts and colouring matter; the substance thus
  formed is hard and tough. In other Orders the chitin of the exoskeleton is without chalky matter
  and is much more flexible. The length of the body, as may be seen from the classification, may be
  either very long, as in <i>Julus</i>, or very short, as in <i>Glomeris</i>.</p>

  <p>The next anatomical character distinctive of the Order is the form of the appendages. First,
  the antennae. These are, as a general rule, much shorter than in the Chilopods, never reaching the
  length of half the body. They are, as a rule, club-shaped, the terminal half being thicker than
  the half adjoining the body.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page53"><span class="smaller">{53}</span></span></div>

  <p>The next appendages to be mentioned are the <i>mouth parts</i>. These differ in form from those
  of the other Orders, and their differences are connected very largely with the fact that the
  Chilognatha live on vegetable substances. Their mouth parts are adapted for chewing, except in the
  case of the Polyzoniidae, the eighth family of the Order, in which, according to Brandt, the mouth
  parts are adapted for sucking, and are prolonged into a kind of proboscis. The mouth parts of the
  Chilognatha consist of&mdash;</p>

  <div class="fine sp2">
    <p>(1) <i>An upper lip.</i> A transversely-placed plate, which is fused with the rest of the
    head.</p>
    <p>(2) A pair of powerful mandibles or jaws adapted for mastication, and moved by powerful
    muscles. <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> in Fig. 33 shows these mandibles, while the rest of the figure
    constitutes the broad plate (No. 3).</p>
    <p class="sp0">(3) A broad plate covering the under part of the head and partially enclosing the
    mouth. This structure, which, as we shall afterwards see, is formed by the fusion of two
    appendages which are distinct in the animal when just hatched, has been called the deutomalae,
    the jaws receiving the name of protomalae.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">
    <a href="images/fig33.jpg"><img style="width:18%" src="images/fig33.jpg" alt="fig33"
    title="fig33" ></a>
    <div class="smaller aj">
      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 33.</span>&mdash;Mouth parts of <i>Chilognatha</i>. (From
      C. L. Koch, <i>System der Myriapoden</i>.) <i>f</i> and <i>g</i>, The mandibles. The parts
      marked <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i> are firmly united and constitute the
      broad plate No. 3. They have received the following names&mdash;<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, Internal
      stipes; <i>c</i>, external stipes; <i>d</i>, malellae; <i>e</i>, hypostoma.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>After the mouth parts we come to the legs. We first notice the fact that the bases of the legs
  in each pair are closely approached to one another. They are so set into the body that the basal
  joints, or, as they are called, the coxal joints, nearly touch. This is the case in almost all
  Chilognatha, except in the Polyxenidae, and it is a fact connected with some important features in
  the internal anatomy. Then we have the peculiarity in the Chilognatha which has formed the basis
  of most classifications which have placed these animals in a group by themselves. This is the
  possession in most segments of two pairs of legs. This characteristic has caused the group to be
  called by some naturalists Diplopoda. As a general rule, the first four segments <span
  class="pagenum" id="page54"><span class="smaller">{54}</span></span>have only three pairs of legs
  between them, one of them being without a pair of legs. This legless or apodal segment is usually
  the third. From the fifth segment to the end of the body all the segments have two pairs of legs
  each. The legs are shorter than those of the Chilopods, and are all nearly equal in size. This is
  not the case in the other Orders. The legs are commonly wanting in the seventh segment of the
  male, and are replaced by a copulatory organ. This peculiarity is related to the different
  position of the generative openings in the Chilognatha. Another anatomical feature peculiar to the
  Chilognatha is the possession of the stink glands&mdash;the <i>glandulae odoriferae</i> before
  mentioned. This, however, is a character which does not hold for all the Chilognatha, since the
  Polyxenidae have none of these glands. All the other families, however, possess them, and they are
  present in none of the other Orders.</p>

  <p>As regards the internal anatomy of the Chilognatha, the <i>digestive canal</i> differs mainly
  in the glands which supply it with secretions. It receives the saliva from two long tubular
  salivary glands, which open at the base of the four-lobed plate which has been mentioned as the
  third of the mouth appendages. The secretion of these glands is used, as has already been said, in
  the process of preparing the nest for the eggs. We cannot fail to be reminded of a similar
  function of salivary glands in those swallows, which prepare the nests of which bird's-nest soup
  is made with the secretion of the salivary glands. Another feature in the form of the digestive
  tube is that in many cases, if not in all, it is marked with constrictions which correspond with
  the segments of the body.</p>

  <p>The <i>heart</i> in the Chilognatha is not such a highly developed organ as in the other
  Orders. The muscles which have already been mentioned as the <i>alary</i> muscles (or wing-shaped
  muscles) are not so highly developed, and consist for the most part of a few muscular fibres. The
  muscular walls of the heart, which consist of three layers, have the muscles less strongly
  developed, and are in general adapted for a less energetic circulation.</p>

  <p>The <i>tracheae</i>, which open into the stigmata, as has already been said, branch into tufts
  of fine tubes, but the ramifications of these tufts never join (or anastomose, as it is called),
  and consequently we never get, as in the other Orders, long tracheal trunks running along the
  body.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page55"><span class="smaller">{55}</span></span></div>

  <p>The <i>nervous system</i>, in addition to the existence of the visceral nerve system described
  by Newport, shows a marked peculiarity in the form of the ventral ganglionic chain. As has already
  been said, the nerve system consists of a brain or mass of ganglia fused together and connected
  with the ventral nervous cord by a collar of nervous substance surrounding the oesophagus, and
  generally known as the <i>circumoesophageal</i> collar. The ventral nerve cord is a stout cord of
  nervous substance passing along the whole length of the animal, and situated below (or ventral to)
  the digestive tube and the generative system. This cord is enlarged at certain points, and these
  enlargements or swellings are called ganglia, while from the ganglia pass off nerves which supply
  the different organs of the body. In the Chilognatha the cord has a compressed appearance as if
  the ganglia were pressed into one another in such a way that it is very hard to distinguish any
  ganglia at all. If we use the microscope and examine sections cut transversely through the cord,
  we see that it is not a simple cord. Even if we examine the nerve cord with a simple lens, we see
  that a furrow runs longitudinally down it, and the use of the compound microscope shows us that
  this furrow represents a division into two cords in such a way that the single stout cord as it
  appeared to the naked eye is in reality two cords running side by side, and so compressed together
  that the substance is partly fused together. The ganglia too are double, being swellings of the
  two cords and not a single enlargement on a single cord. As we shall see in the other Orders, this
  arrangement constitutes a characteristic distinction.</p>

  <p>The <i>generative organs</i> consist of a long tubular ovary or testis lying along almost the
  whole length of the body and placed between the digestive organ and the nervous system. Near its
  exit from the body the long tube divides into two short tubes, the oviducts in the female or the
  vasa <i>deferentia</i> in the male. These ducts open in the third segment of the body, unlike
  those of Myriapods belonging to other Orders. The accessory glands present in most other Myriapods
  are not present in the Chilognatha.</p>

  <p>The general arrangement of the organs of the Chilognatha may be seen from Fig. 34, which
  represents a transverse section through the body of <i>Polyxenus</i> (Fig. 18). A comparison of
  <span class="pagenum" id="page56"><span class="smaller">{56}</span></span>these two figures (Figs.

  <p class="ac"><b>Order II. Chilopoda.</b></p>

  <p>The shape of the body differs from that of the Order which has been just described
  (Chilognatha), inasmuch as it is not cylindrical but flattened, the back, however, being more
  arched than the ventral surface. In this respect, however, it cannot be said to differ from the
  other Orders which we have yet to describe.</p>

  <p>The segments are not formed by a single ring of the exoskeleton, which in this Order is formed
  of chitin, and is tough and flexible rather than hard and strong; but of two or three plates which
  form a covering to the segment. The back is covered by a large plate known as the <i>tergum</i>,
  the sides by two plates known as <i>pleura</i>, and the ventral part by a plate called the
  <i>sternum</i>. The pleura and sternum are, however, in most cases fused together or
  indistinguishable. In this, as in most of the anatomical peculiarities, there is a much greater
  difference between the two Orders Chilopoda and Chilognatha than between <span class="pagenum"
  id="page57"><span class="smaller">{57}</span></span>the Chilopoda and the other three Orders which
  have still to be described.</p>

  <p>The Chilopoda have only one pair of appendages to each segment of the body instead of two pairs
  like the Chilognatha.</p>

  <p>The antennae of the Chilopoda are as a rule very long, and are always longer than in the
  Chilognatha which we have just described. They differ from those of the Schizotarsia (the third
  Order, which will be the next to be described) in having the basal joints nearer together; in
  other words, they are differently placed on the head. They differ from those of the Pauropoda (the
  fifth Order) in being straight and not branched. As a rule the antennae of the Chilopoda taper
  towards the extremity.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The mouth parts are more numerous than in the Order we have just described (the Chilognatha).
  They consist of&mdash;</p>

  <div class="fine sp2">
    <p>1. An upper lip.  This is a transverse plate as just described in the case of the
    Chilognatha, but it is not always fused with the rest of the head. It is also usually composed
    of three pieces, two lateral and a middle piece.</p>
    <p>2. A pair of <i>jaws</i> or <i>mandibles</i>, which are not of so simple a form as those of
    the Chilognatha, but rather resemble those of some of the Crustacea.</p>
    <p>3 and 4. Two pairs of appendages called maxillae resembling feet, but used to aid the act of
    eating instead of locomotion. They are very different in different Chilopods, but are mostly
    slender and weak and usually provided with feelers (or palps) growing out of the main stem.</p>
    <div><span class="pagenum" id="page58"><span class="smaller">{58}</span></span></div>
    <p class="sp0">5. The next pair of appendages are the first pair of the legs of the body, which
    are also metamorphosed to serve a function different from the ambulatory function of the other
    limbs. These are the <i>poison claws</i>, and the possession of these forms another distinction
    between the Order we are now discussing and that of the Chilognatha. At the same time the third
    Order, that of the Schizotarsia, has poison claws, so that this feature does not separate the
    Chilopoda from all the other Orders. These poison claws are large curved claws connected with
    poison glands, the secretion of which flows through a canal which opens near the point.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The <i>legs</i> are longer than those of the Chilognatha, but not so long as those in the next
  Order to be described (the Schizotarsia). Their number is very various, from 15 pairs in
  <i>Lithobius</i> to 173 in the Geophilidae. Latzel notes a curious point in the number of the legs
  in this Order, namely, the number of pairs of legs is always an uneven one. There are always one
  pair to each segment. The last pair of legs is always longer than the other pairs, and this is a
  peculiarity of the Order.</p>

  <p>The <i>digestive tube</i> resembles that of the other Orders, but the salivary glands are not
  long and tubular but short (Fig. 28, <i>d</i>). It is, moreover, not marked with constrictions
  corresponding with the segments of the body.</p>

  <p>The <i>tracheal</i> system or the system of respiration may be said to be more highly developed
  in this Order than in any other. The tracheal branches anastomose with one another (that is, the
  branches join), and in some cases form long tracheal stems running along the body almost for its
  whole length. The number of the tracheal openings or stigmata varies and does not correspond with
  the number of segments.</p>

  <p>The <i>nervous system</i> differs considerably from that in the Order Chilognatha; it resembles
  that in the Schizotarsia, and differs again from that in the other two Orders, Symphyla and
  Pauropoda. The brain shows some differences from other Orders chiefly in the development of the
  different lobes which are connected with the sense organs, the eyes and antennae, for instance;
  but the most marked difference is in the ventral ganglionic cord. First, the ganglionic swellings
  are much more clearly marked than in the Chilognatha. Secondly, the first three ganglia differ
  <span class="pagenum" id="page59"><span class="smaller">{59}</span></span>from the others in being
  nearer to one another and forming a single mass when seen by the naked eye, though when examined
  by the aid of a microscope we can see all the different parts are there. Thirdly, the division
  into two cords mentioned in the Chilognatha is carried to a much greater extent. The ganglia in
  each segment can be seen plainly to be double, and the cords connecting the ganglia are two in
  number. We can plainly see that the ventral nervous system of the Chilopoda consists of two cords
  lying parallel to one another, and each having a ganglionic enlargement in every segment. Whether
  a visceral nervous system is present in the group is doubtful.</p>

  <p>The eighth family of the Chilognatha, the Polyxenidae, show an approach to the Chilopod nervous
  system.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The generative system differs chiefly in the opening of the genital apparatus at
  the end of the body instead of in the third segment; though this difference only separates the
  Order from the Chilognatha and not from the other Orders. They also have two pairs of large
  accessory glands (as they are called) connected with the genital openings.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order III. Schizotarsia.</b></p>

  <p>The third Order of Myriapods, the Schizotarsia, show a much greater resemblance to the
  Chilopoda than to the first Order, the Chilognatha. There are, however, important differences to
  distinguish them from all the other Orders.</p>

  <p>The shape of the body is short, thick, and very compact. The composition of the individual
  segments resembles that found in Chilopoda rather than that of Chilognatha.</p>

  <p>The antennae are very long, longer than in any of the Chilopods, and are composed of a great
  number of very small joints. The mouth parts show a greater length and slenderness than do those
  of the other Orders mentioned as yet. They consist of&mdash;</p>

  <div class="fine sp2">
    <p>1. An <i>upper lip</i> partly free, but fused at the sides with the rest of the head. The
    upper lip is in three parts, as in the Chilopoda, but with the middle part very small and the
    lateral pieces large.</p>
    <p>2. A pair of <i>jaws</i> or <i>mandibles</i>. These are provided not only with teeth, as in
    the other Myriapods, but also with a sort of comb of stiff bristles.</p>
    <div><span class="pagenum" id="page60"><span class="smaller">{60}</span></span></div>
    <p>3 and 4. Two pairs of <i>maxillae</i> or foot jaws distinguished by their length and
    slenderness.</p>
    <p class="sp0">5. The <i>poison claws</i> long, slender, and not sharply curved. The bases of
    the poison claws hardly fused together and short.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The <i>respiratory system</i> in the Schizotarsia differs from that in all other Myriapods in
  the fact before mentioned, that they breathe by means of lungs and not by tracheae. There are, as
  before mentioned, eight dorsal scales in these animals; each dorsal scale except the last bears
  one of the peculiar organs which I have called lungs. At the hinder end of the scale there is a
  slit which leads into an air sac, from which a number of short tubes project into the blood in the
  space round the heart and serve to aerate it before it enters the heart. The heart, therefore,
  sends aerated blood to the organs, while in the tracheal-breathing Myriapods the blood is aerated
  in the organs themselves by means of tracheae.</p>

  <p>The poison claws are followed by segments bearing fifteen pairs of true ambulatory legs. These
  are covered by eight large dorsal plates, increasing in size from before to the middle of the
  body, the middle plate being the largest, and then diminishing in size.</p>

  <p>The <i>nervous system</i> resembles that of the Chilopoda, but there is a special pair of
  nerves which supply the sense organ, which has been mentioned as peculiar to the Order. The
  ventral nerve cord shows a very clear division into two, the ganglia of the two cords being almost
  entirely separate. The first few ganglia are fused, as has been mentioned in the Chilopoda.</p>

  <p>The <i>digestive tube</i> resembles that of the Chilopoda. The legs are very long and slender,
  and the joints are beset with bristles. Both sexes have small hook-like appendages at the sides of
  the genital openings.</p>

  <p>The eyes have already been mentioned as being more highly developed than in other classes, in
  correspondence with the more active habits of the animal. The generative organs open at the hind
  end of the body, as in Chilopoda.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The heart is highly developed, quite as much so as the Chilopod heart, the alary
  muscles being strong and broad, and the arteries being quite as perfect as those in any Myriapod.
  The muscular coats which govern the pulsations by their contractions are powerful and well
  developed.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page61"><span class="smaller">{61}</span></span></div>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order IV. Symphyla.</b></p>

  <p>We next come to one of the last two Orders which have been recently added to the Myriapoda.
  These little animals have a great resemblance to the Thysanura among the Insects, and especially
  to <i>Campodea</i> among the Thysanura. It will be well, therefore, to begin our account with a
  few of the reasons which have induced naturalists to include them among the Myriapods rather than
  among the Thysanura.</p>

  <div class="fine sp2">
    <p>1. <i>Campodea</i> has three pairs of mouth appendages, while <i>Scolopendrella</i> has only
    two.</p>
    <p>2. <i>Scolopendrella</i> has broad plates covering the back, not only on the anterior
    (thoracic) segments, but on the whole body.</p>
    <p>3. The terminal appendages of <i>Scolopendrella</i> differ from those in <i>Campodea</i>.</p>
    <p>4. <i>Scolopendrella</i> has a sense organ which is absent in <i>Campodea</i>.</p>
    <p>5. <i>Campodea</i> breathes by means of three stigmata in the anterior part of the body.  The
    stigmata of <i>Scolopendrella</i> are hard to see, and are not in the same position.</p>
    <p class="sp0">6. <i>Scolopendrella</i> has twelve pairs of legs, and <i>Campodea</i>, like all
    Insects, has only three.</p>
  </div>

  <p>I will now go on to an account of their anatomy. The body is small and slender, and is covered
  with a delicate shell or exoskeleton of chitin, which is so thin as to be almost transparent.</p>

  <p>The <i>antennae</i> are long, and are composed of many joints of equal size.</p>

  <p>The <i>mouth parts</i> consist of&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>1. An upper lip.</p>
    <p>2. A pair of mandibles.</p>
    <p>3. A pair of maxillae.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The segments are not all of equal size. Some are larger than others. The larger and smaller
  segments are arranged alternately, and the smaller do not bear legs. As before stated, there are
  twelve leg-bearing segments.</p>

  <p>At the end of the body there are two hook-like appendages which are pierced by a canal, through
  which is poured the secretion of a pair of glands. Near the sides of these appendages are a pair
  of sense organs, consisting of long hairs connected with nerves.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page62"><span class="smaller">{62}</span></span></div>

  <p>The digestive canal is a long straight tube passing through the length of the body. In the
  middle it is much enlarged, so as to form a stomach with a glandular coat. Posterior to the
  stomach the digestive tube receives the contents of two Malpighian tubes which act as kidneys.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The tracheal system consists of a single pair of stigmata on the under surface of
  the head, and the tracheae connected with them.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order V. Pauropoda.</b></p>

  <p>The Pauropoda, which form the fifth Order of Myriapods, are as yet very imperfectly known.
  <i>Pauropus</i> was discovered by Sir John Lubbock, and its discovery was announced by him in
  1866. He found this little Centipede in his kitchen garden among some Thysanura, and at first
  considered it as a larval form, but continued observation showed that it was a mature creature. He
  described it as a small, white, bustling, intelligent little creature about <span
  class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">25</span> inch in length.</p>

  <p>The antennae are very curious and highly characteristic of the Order. They resemble those of
  Crustacea rather than those of Myriapoda. Each antenna is composed in the following manner. First
  there is a shaft of four joints. From the fourth joint of this shaft spring two branches; one of
  these two branches is narrower than the other, and ends in a long thin bristle composed of a great
  number of joints. The other and broader branch bears two such bristles, and between them a small
  pear-shaped or globular body, the function of which is unknown.</p>

  <p>The mouth parts consist of two minute pairs of appendages, the anterior pair toothed and the
  posterior pointed. The body is rather narrower in front; the segment behind the head has one pair
  of legs, the second, third, fourth, and fifth behind the head two each. The posterior legs are the
  longest; the genital organs open at the base of the second pair of legs, between these and the
  third pair. The manner of breathing is as yet unknown, tracheae not having been discovered.</p>

  <p><i>Pauropus</i> at first looks most like a Chilopod, but differs from that Order&mdash;</p>

  <div class="fine sp2">
    <p>1. In the form of the antennae.</p>
    <p>2. In the absence of poison claws and in the form of the mouth parts.</p>

    <p class="sp0">3. The opening of the generative organs being in the front part of the body.</p>

  <p>It differs from Chilognatha in the following respects<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

    <p>1. The legs are not of equal length, the posterior legs being the longest, as in

    Chilopods.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Embryology.</b></p>

  <p>The preceding account of the anatomy of Myriapods would be incomplete without some reference to
  the wonderful manner in which the different organs of the body are built up; the whole of the
  complex organism proceeding by a gradual and regulated process of development from a simple cell
  called the ovum derived from the female body, and united with a cell from the male body (called
  the spermatozoon). I hope to be able to give my readers some idea of the interest which the
  pursuit of the difficult study of embryology adds to anatomy, by offering us a key to the
  interpretation of the relations between our knowledge of the forms at present living on the earth
  and those which, we learn from Palaeontology, have inhabited our planet in past ages.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 36.</span>&mdash;Young ovum of <i>Julus terrestris</i>:
      <i>nucl</i>, nucleolus; <i>nu</i>, nucleus; <i>R</i>, first appearance of yolk; <i>F</i>,
      follicle cells.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Like all living creatures with which we are acquainted, the starting-point of Myriapod life is
  the <i>ovum</i>, as it is called. This <i>ovum</i> is a <i>cell</i> resembling the cells of which
  the body of all living animals are built up, and which may be compared to the bricks of which a
  building is composed. This cell or ovum is a small sphere of living transparent substance called
  protoplasm, and it is <i>nucleated</i>&mdash;that is, it contains a small spot of denser
  protoplasm called the nucleus, and within that a still smaller spot of still more dense protoplasm
  called the nucleolus. In the process of impregnation the ovum unites with the male cell, and the
  cell so formed is called the impregnated ovum. This ovum has the property of dividing into two
  cells, each resembling the <span class="pagenum" id="page64"><span
  class="smaller">{64}</span></span>parent cell from which it is derived; each of these cells has,
  like the parent cell, the same property of dividing into two more, and so on. Thus from this
  continual process of division or reproduction of every living cell, the materials are provided for
  the building up of the body.</p>

  <p>The regularity of the process of the division of the ovum, or, as it is called, <i>segmentation
  of the ovum</i>, is interfered with by the presence of <i>food yolk</i>. The cells formed by the
  process of cell division just described need nourishment, and this nourishment is supplied to them
  by the food yolk formed in the body of the ovum before the process of segmentation begins. It is
  easy to understand that this yolk, which is not <i>alive</i> like the cells, cannot divide like
  them, and therefore the segmentation of the ovum in Myriapods is <i>irregular</i>, as it is
  called.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">
    <a href="images/fig37.jpg"><img style="width:37%" src="images/fig37.jpg" alt="fig37"

      <i>c.p</i>, nucleus; <i>y.sp</i>, yolk spherules; <i>ch</i>, shell.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I will now go back a little and describe what happens to the ovum before the process of
  segmentation is complete. It increases in size and forms the supply of food yolk which is to
  provide the nutriment of the ovum. Then after impregnation the egg-shell is formed round it, and
  it becomes what we know as the egg. This egg is not a perfect sphere, but is oval (in most
  Myriapods) in shape. The egg is laid, and the process of segmentation begins shortly after it is
  laid, as has already been described.</p>

  <p>When it has been laid for about 36 hours, if we take an egg and, after proper preparation, cut
  it into thin slices known to <span class="pagenum" id="page65"><span
  class="smaller">{65}</span></span>microscopists by the name of sections, and examine it by means
  of the microscope, we shall see that segmentation has resulted in this. Just beneath the egg-shell
  there is a thin layer of cells, one cell thick, which completely surrounds the egg. Inside this
  coat of cells is the food yolk, with a few cells scattered about in it at rare intervals,
  something like the raisins in a plum-pudding.</p>

  <p>With the next process the formation of the young Myriapod may be said to begin. A strip along
  the length of the oval-shaped egg is thickened, and this thick mass of cells represents the future
  ventral surface of the animal. The rest of the thin layer of cells already mentioned just below
  the shell will form the shell or exoskeleton of the future animal. The thick strip of cells at the
  ventral surface has by this time split into layers, so that, resorting to our microscope again, a
  section through the short axis of the oval-shaped egg&mdash;a transverse section&mdash;will show
  us&mdash;</p>

  <div class="fine sp2">
    <p>1. The egg-shell.</p>
    <p>2. A layer of cells completely surrounding the egg, thin everywhere but on the ventral
    surface. This layer is known to embryologists as the <i>epiblast</i>. The thick part of the
    epiblast on the ventral surface gives rise to the nervous system.</p>
    <p>3 and 4. Two layers of cells connected in the middle, along the line of the thick strip, but
    separate elsewhere, and not extending round the whole of the inside. These layers constitute
    what is known as the mesoblast, and give rise to the muscles and most of the internal
    organs.</p>
    <p class="sp0">5. The scattered cells in the yolk. They are known as the hypoblast and give rise
    to the digestive canal.</p>
  </div>

  <p>After this point is reached the formation of the organs begins. The segments are formed in
  order from before backwards. First the head, then the next segment, and so on. When the number of
  segments with which the animal will be hatched are formed, another process begins, and the tail
  end of the animal, which can already be distinguished, is bent towards the head. This is a process
  that takes place in many animals besides Myriapods, and is called the formation of the ventral
  flexure. Shortly after this the animal bursts the shell and comes <span class="pagenum"
  id="page66"><span class="smaller">{66}</span></span>into the outer world. The various processes
  may be understood by reference to the Figs. 36, 37, 38, 39, which are successive stages in the
  development of a Chilognath. Figs. 37, 38, are thin slices through the shorter diameter of the
  egg, which, as before mentioned, is an oval in shape. Fig. 39 is a section through the longer
  diameter of an egg in a more advanced stage of development, in fact just about to burst the shell.
  The body of the future animal is marked by constrictions, the future segments. Some of the organs
  are already formed, as the brain and the digestive tube, the openings of which will form the mouth
  (<i>st</i>) and the anus (<i>pr</i>).</p>

  <p>Myriapods are hatched at different stages of development. The Chilognatha have only three
  appendages, which are so little developed that they are only small shapeless stumps, while <span
  class="pagenum" id="page67"><span class="smaller">{67}</span></span>the Chilopoda have the full
  number of legs in some cases; in others only a small number of legs, but yet more than the three
  pairs of legs of the Chilognatha, and fully developed instead of stump-like. The eyes are usually
  developed late in the life of the young animal. The bursting of the egg-shell is assisted in some
  Myriapods by a special kind of spike on the back part of the head.</p>

  <p>The Fig. 40 shows a young Chilognath which has just burst the shell and come into the outer
  world. It is still surrounded with a membrane which has been formed by its skin or epiblast within
  the egg. One eye-spot has been formed.</p>

  <p>After the animal is hatched it has still, in the case of most Myriapods (those which are not
  hatched with all the segments complete), to undergo a further development, and in particular the
  eyes are still unformed. The process of development of the eye has only been followed out as yet
  in the Chilognatha, and in only one form, <i>Julus</i>, and is so curious that a short account may
  be of interest here. The development of the eye begins (in <i>Julus</i>) on the fourth day after
  hatching, and continues until the animal is full grown. A single <span class="pagenum"
  id="page69"><span class="smaller">{69}</span></span>ocellus or eye-spot appears first, and the
  rest are added one by one until the full number are reached.</p>

  <p>The first appearances connected with the formation of the eye take place in the cellular layer
  just beneath the chitinous exoskeleton. This layer, called the hypodermis, plays an important part
  in the organisation of the animal. It forms the inner layer of what we may call the skin of the
  animal, and the cells of which it is composed secrete the chitin of which the shell or exoskeleton
  of the animal is composed, and which is moulted every year.</p>

  <p>The first process in the formation of the eye-spot is the thickening of the hypodermis beneath
  the chitin, just in the place where the eye will come. At the same time the cells of this
  thickened mass of hypodermis secrete a quantity of pigment of a dark red brown colour. Next the
  cells of the thick mass of hypodermis begin to separate from one another in such a way that a
  vesicle is formed. This vesicle is hollow inside, and the thick walls are formed from the cells of
  the thickened hypodermic mass. This can be seen from Fig. 44, which represents a section through
  an ocellus when it is partly formed. From this vesicle the eye is formed.</p>

  <p>The wall of the vesicle nearest the exoskeleton gives rise to the lens of the eye, while the
  other walls of the vesicle form the retinal parts of the eye. The cells from the brain grow out
  and form the optic nerve connecting the retina with the brain. The whole eye spot is covered
  internally by a thin membrane, formed not from the hypodermis but by cells from the inside of the
  body (mesoblast cells).</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the Chilognatha, the first Order of Myriapods, the young <span class="pagenum"
  id="page70"><span class="smaller">{70}</span></span>animal leaves the egg with three pairs of
  appendages; the first have already the form of antennae, the second will form the jaws, but have
  not yet taken their proper form, while the third pair will fuse together and alter their shape so
  as to form the curious plate that has already been mentioned as forming the second pair of mouth
  appendages. Behind the mouth appendages will come the first three pairs of legs. The whole young
  animal on leaving the egg is enveloped in two membranes. These membranes are secreted by the
  outside layer of cells in the same way that the shell or exoskeleton of the animal will be
  eventually formed, and represent the first two moults of the animal, which continues to moult its
  shell every year throughout life.</p>

  <p>Of the Chilopoda, the second Order of Myriapods, all the families leave the egg-shell with the
  full number of legs, with the exception of the Lithobiidae, which have seven pairs of legs
  including the poison-claws. The Schizotarsia, the third Order, also have seven pairs of legs when
  hatched.</p>

  <p>The legs make their appearance not one by one but in batches (in <i>Julus terrestris</i> in
  batches of five). The addition of legs and segments to the body takes place, not at the end of the
  body, but between the end segment and the penultimate.</p>

  <p>This is a short sketch of the gradual development of the Myriapoda from the ovum to the
  fully-grown animal. It is, I am aware, a short and insufficient account of all the beautiful
  processes by which the different organs take their rise, but space is insufficient here, and too
  much detail would be out of place in a work of this nature, which only aims at giving an outline
  sketch of the group, which shall be intelligible to the general reader who has not made a special
  study of such matters. Before leaving the subject, however, I must mention a few of the points of
  interest which are to be learned from the examination of the course of development which has been
  sketched here. One of the greatest puzzles in the natural history of the Order Chilognatha has
  always been the double segments, as they are called; that is, in fact, the possession of two pairs
  of legs to each segment, which is, as we have already said, a distinguishing characteristic of the
  Order. As we have seen, the Chilognatha at an early stage of existence do not possess this
  characteristic, which is only peculiar to the adult <span class="pagenum" id="page71"><span
  class="smaller">{71}</span></span>and half-grown forms. Now what does this mean? Does each double
  segment in the full-grown Millepede represent two segments which have become fused together, or is
  each double segment, so called, a real segment resembling the segments present in the other Orders
  (for instance, Chilopoda), which has grown an extra pair of legs? Both these views have been
  advocated by distinguished naturalists. Neither of them is, in my opinion, quite right when viewed
  in the light cast on the subject by recent investigations into the life history of the
  Chilognatha.</p>

  <p>A close examination into the minutiae of the growth of the different organs has shown us that
  the double characters of the double segments are more deeply seated than was imagined. The
  circulatory system, the nerve cord, and the first traces of segmentation in the mesoblast all show
  this double character, and the only single part about the segment is the broad plate covering the
  segment. Now in some of the most ancient of the fossil Myriapods this broad plate shows traces of
  a division, as if it were in reality two plates fused together. We have also to consider that the
  life history of the Chilognatha allows us to believe that the peculiar cylindrical shape of the
  body shown in the greatest degree in the Julidae is attained by the unequal development of the
  dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body; the ventral surface being compressed together till it is
  extremely narrow, and the dorsal surface, as it were, growing round it till the originally dorsal
  surface forms almost a complete ring round the body. Taking all this into consideration, we are
  justified, in my opinion, in concluding that each double segment in the Chilognatha is not two
  segments fused together, nor a single segment bearing two pairs of legs, but is two complete
  segments perfect in all particulars, but united by a large dorsal plate which was originally two
  plates which have been fused together, and which in most Chilognatha surrounds almost the whole of
  two segments in the form of a ring.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Again in the Chilopoda we see that a great distinctive feature that separates them
  from the Chilognatha is the character of the ventral nerve cord, the cord being double and not
  single, a character connected with the fact that the bases of the legs are widely separated from
  one another, and not closely approached to each other, as in the Chilognatha. As we before said, a
  more <span class="pagenum" id="page72"><span class="smaller">{72}</span></span>minute anatomical
  examination showed us that this difference was not so great as appeared at first sight, the cord
  showing traces of a duplication. Well, are these traces superficial, or do they represent a state
  of affairs more or less similar to that in the Chilopoda? Embryology helps us to answer this
  question also. In the early stages of the Chilognatha we find that the nerve cord has exactly the
  form of that in Chilopoda, showing us that the appearances in the anatomy had led us to a right
  conclusion, and giving us a valuable confirmation of our views. These two examples will serve to
  show the kind of interest which attaches to embryology.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Palaeontology.</b></p>

  <p>We have seen that embryology enables us to look at the structure of the Myriapods from a new
  standpoint, and to correct and supplement the knowledge gained from an examination of the adult
  animal. In the same way a study of the forms of Myriapods which have become extinct on the globe,
  and have been preserved to us in a fossil form, gives a further opportunity of considering the
  relations of one form to another, and again of the relations of our group to other groups of
  animals now existing on the earth. Myriapod fossils have been found in strata of great antiquity.
  The oldest of such fossils must have been among the first land animals. The figure below shows a
  fossil Myriapod found in America, belonging to the Order of the Protosyngnatha which are only
  found in the Palaeozoic strata. It is a good example of the manner in which Myriapods were
  protected by bundles of bristles in the same way as the <i>Polyxenus</i> of the present time.</p>

  <p>The oldest fossil Myriapods which have been discovered at the present time are two species
  which have been found in the Old Red Sandstone in Scotland. To realise the antiquity of these
  Myriapods, it will be worth while recalling the typical fossils found in the Old Red Sandstone, so
  as to see what the contemporaries of these ancient Myriapods were like. Among the plants there
  were Algae, Ferns, and Conifers, belonging to the lower divisions of the plant tribe. Among the
  animals there were Sponges, Corals, Starfish, Worms, Shell-fish, and Fishes, but none of the more
  highly organised of the animal or vegetable tribe <span class="pagenum" id="page73"><span
  class="smaller">{73}</span></span>had appeared on the earth. The Myriapods of the Old Red
  Sandstone, as has been before said, differ considerably from those of the present day, and as we
  proceed towards the species found in the more recent strata we find them more and more like the
  ones at present living, till we get to the <i>Polyxenus</i> and other species found in amber,
  which are hardly to be distinguished from living forms.</p>

  <p>The next oldest fossil Myriapods are found in the coal measures, when both the animal and
  vegetable kingdoms were represented by more numerous and more specialised forms. The fossil fauna
  of this period is characterised by the number of gigantic Amphibia, many remains of which have
  been found. The great forests and the abundant vegetation of this time must have been favourable
  to the existence of our class, and accordingly we find no less than 32 species of fossil
  Myriapods. Of these most have been found in America, some in Great Britain, and some in Germany.
  One well-preserved fossil of <i>Xylobius sigillariae</i> was found by Dr. Dawson in America in the
  stump of a tree in the remains of a fossil forest. The eyes, head, and legs were plainly seen
  under the microscope. All these fossils belong to the earliest or Palaeozoic period.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The figure below (Fig. 46) shows a fossil also from the coal formations of Illinois, America,
  belonging to the family of the Euphoberiidae mentioned further on. It shows a nearer approach to
  the Julidae of the present time. The limbs, however, were of very curious shape, and may possibly
  have been adapted to locomotion in water as well as on land, and the small supposed branchiae on
  the ventral surface shown in Fig. 46, B, may possibly have been an arrangement to render
  respiration in the water possible.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page74"><span class="smaller">{74}</span></span></div>

  <p>In the secondary period the Myriapods were scantily represented, or, at any rate, geologists
  have failed to find their fossils. The class is represented by a single specimen found in the
  chalk in Greenland. This fossil, which has been included in the Julidae under the name of
  <i>Julopsis cretacea</i>, may perhaps belong to the Archipolypoda.</p>

  <p>Passing on to the Tertiary or Recent period, we find the Myriapods again numerous, and more
  nearly resembling those living at the present time. They belong mostly to the Chilognatha and
  Chilopoda. They have been found in the fresh-water gypsum of Provence in France, the brown coal of
  Germany, and the green river formations of America. Several have been found in amber.</p>

  <p>Fossil Myriapods have been divided into four Orders, two of which coincide with the Orders of
  living Myriapods; the differences between the fossils and the living Myriapods having been held
  insufficient to warrant the establishment of a new Order. These two Orders are the Chilopoda and
  the Diplopoda or Chilognatha (Diplopoda is another name used by some writers for the group which
  we have hitherto called Chilognatha). The other two Orders have sufficient differences from living
  forms to render it necessary to include them in separate Orders.</p>

  <p class="sp3">I will now give a short account of the different Orders, and the fossil forms which
  are included in them.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order I. Protosyngnatha.</b></p>

  <p class="sp3">This Order is represented by a single fossil (Fig. 45), discovered in the coal at
  Mazon Creek, Illinois, America, by Meek and Worth. It differs greatly from any of those in
  existence at the present day. The body is cylindrical, and composed of ten segments. The cephalic
  appendages (that is, the antennae and mouth parts) are inserted into a single unsegmented cephalic
  mass (the head). Each segment behind the head bears a single dorsal and ventral plate of equal
  breadth and length. The limbs are placed in these plates with a wide space between the base of
  each leg and that of the opposite one of the pair. Along the back, bundles of bristles are
  arranged in longitudinal rows.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order II. Chilopoda.</b></p>

  <p>The fossil forms of this Order resemble those of the Chilopoda of the present day. The oldest
  of them are found in amber. The following families have been found<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="fine sp2">
    <p><i>Lithobiidae.</i> Several species have been found in amber.</p>
    <p><i>Scolopendridae.</i> One species in amber, several species in later Tertiary
    formations.</p>
    <p class="sp0"><i>Geophilidae.</i> Three species in amber.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">Two species resembling the Schizotarsia of the present day have been found in
  amber.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page76"><span class="smaller">{76}</span></span></div>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order III. Archipolypoda.</b></p>

  <p>The most numerous of the fossil families. With a few exceptions, all the Palaeozoic (that is,
  the oldest) Myriapods belong to this Order. The Carboniferous Archipolypoda seem to be much more
  numerous in the coal of America than in that of England. They resemble for the most part the
  Myriapods of the present day, except that all the segments without exception bear legs.</p>

  <p>The families are three in number.</p>

  <div class="fine sp3">
    <p>Family 1. <i>Archidesmidae.</i></p>

    same formation is called <i>Archidesmus</i>.</p>
    <p>Family 2. <i>Euphoberiidae.</i></p>
    <p>They show some resemblance to the <i>Julidae</i> of the present day, but the dorsal scutes,
    or plates of the back, are more or less perfectly divided into two divisions corresponding with
    the pairs of legs. The following are the principal fossils of this family<span

  <p>Now that we have considered the structure of the Myriapods and the groups into which they are
  subdivided or classified, we may proceed to consider what position they hold in the household of
  nature. That they present certain features of similarity to other classes has been already
  mentioned, and that this is the fact cannot be doubted when we look back at the way in which they
  have been classified in the works of early writers. For example, Lamarck, the great French
  naturalist, classifies them with spiders in his well-known work, <i>La Philosophie Zoologique</i>,
  under the name of <i>Arachnides antennistes</i>. Cuvier, the comparative anatomist, unites them
  with the Insects, making them the first Order, while the Thysanura is the second. We have already
  seen that one Order of Myriapods, the Symphyla, bears a great resemblance to the Thysanura. The
  English naturalist Leach was the first to establish Myriapods as a class, and his arrangement has
  been followed by all naturalists after his time. But while their peculiarities of structure and
  form are sufficiently marked to separate them as a class, it cannot be denied that the older
  naturalists were right to recognise that they have many essential characteristics in common with
  other classes of animals. And recent investigations have emphasised this fact. For instance, let
  us consider the recent discoveries of the Orders of Symphyla and Pauropoda, Orders which, while
  bearing so many of the characters of Myriapods that naturalists have agreed to place them in that
  class, yet resemble in many important points the Insect Order of Thysanura. This seems to justify
  Cuvier in claiming the close relationship for them that he did.</p>

  <p>Recent investigations have also brought out more prominently the resemblances to the Worms. Of
  late, considerable attention has been directed to <i>Peripatus</i> (see <span class="wnw">pp. <a
  href="#page1">1-26</a></span>), and the resemblances to the Myriapods in its anatomy and
  development are such that Latzel has actually included it in the Myriapods as an Order,
  Malacopoda. Now <i>Peripatus</i> also shows resemblances to the annelid Worms, and thus affords us
  a connexion to the Worm type hardly less striking than that to the Insect. This <span
  class="pagenum" id="page78"><span class="smaller">{78}</span></span>resemblance to the Worms,
  which Myriapods certainly bear, was noticed by the ancient writers, and as they had for the most
  part only external appearances to consider, they pushed this idea to extremes in actually
  including some of the marine Worms (Annelida) among the Centipedes. Pliny talks of a marine
  <i>Scolopendra</i> as a very poisonous animal, and there is little doubt that he meant one of the
  marine worms. An old German naturalist, Gesner, in a very curious book published in 1669 gives an
  account of an annelid sea-worm which he calls <i>Scolopendra marina</i>, and which is in all
  probability the sea Scolopendra which Pliny mentions. From Gesner's account it seems to have been
  used as a medicine (externally only). "The use of this animal in medicine. The animal soaked in
  oil makes the hair fall off. So do its ashes mixed in oil." It was also pounded up with honey.</p>

  <p>This idea of Centipedes living in water survived among later naturalists. Charles Owen, the
  author before quoted, mentions them as amphibious in 1742. "The Scolopendra is a little venomous
  worm and amphibious. When it wounds any, there follows a blueness about the affected part and an
  itch all over the body like that caused by nettles. Its weapons of mischief are much the same with
  those of the spider, only larger; its bite is very tormenting, and produces not only pruriginous
  pain in the flesh, but very often distraction of mind. These little creatures make but a mean
  figure in the ranks of animals, yet have been terrible in their exploits, particularly in driving
  people out of their country. Thus the people of Rhytium, a city of Crete, were constrained to
  leave their quarters for them (Aelian, lib. xv. cap. 26)."</p>

  <p>Myriapods have been considered to bear resemblances to the Crustacea, and this to a certain
  extent is true, though only to a certain extent, the resemblances being confined to the more
  general characteristics that they share with other groups of animals.</p>

  <p>Of late years attempts have been made to speculate about the origin of the Myriapods&mdash;that
  is, to endeavour to obtain by means of investigation of their anatomy, embryology, and
  palaeontological history, some idea of the history of the group. Such attempts at research into
  the <i>phylogeny</i>, as it is called, of a group must be more or less speculative until our
  knowledge is much greater than <span class="pagenum" id="page79"><span
  class="smaller">{79}</span></span>it is at present. But such inquiries have their value, and the
  schemes of descent and phylogenetic trees, at any rate, indicate a real relation to different
  groups, even if they do not provide us with a real and actual history of the animals.</p>

  <p>There have been two main theories about the descent of the Myriapoda. One of these derives them
  directly from the Insecta through the forms known as the Thysanura, which resemble in such a
  degree the Myriapod Orders of Symphyla and Pauropoda. The other theory holds that the Myriapods,
  as well as the Insecta, have been derived from some ancestor bearing a resemblance to
  <i>Peripatus</i>. In other words, one theory claims that the relationship of Myriapoda to Insecta
  is that of father and son; the other that the relationship between the two is that of brother to
  brother. The arguments by which these theories are respectively supported consist for the most
  part of an analysis of the different characters of the anatomy and embryology and the
  determination of the most primitive among them. For example, the supporters of the theory that the
  Thysanura are the most nearly allied to the Myriapod ancestor lay great weight on the fact that
  some Myriapods are born with three pairs of legs only, and they compare this stage in the life
  history of the Myriapoda to the metamorphosis and larval stage of Insects. For the supporters of
  this view the Orders of Symphyla and Pauropoda are the most primitive of the Myriapods. On the
  other hand, the followers of the other theory do not allow that the characters in which the
  Myriapods are like Insects are primitive ones, but they lay more stress on the characters found in
  the early development, such as the character of the process of the formation of the body segments,
  the mesoblastic segmentation, and the origin of the various organs of the body.</p>

  <p>It may be easily understood that such differences in the estimation of the primitive characters
  of the embryology of a group may arise. Embryology has been compared by one of the greatest of
  modern embryologists to "an ancient manuscript with many of the sheets lost, others displaced, and
  with spurious passages interpolated by a later hand." What wonder is it that different people
  examining such a record should come to different conclusions as to the more doubtful and difficult
  portions of it. It is this very difficulty which makes the principal interest in the study, and
  although our knowledge of the language in <span class="pagenum" id="page80"><span
  class="smaller">{80}</span></span>which this manuscript is written is as yet imperfect, still we
  hope that constant study may teach us more and more, and enable us to read the great book of
  nature with more and more ease and certainty.</p>

  must refer them to the following works, which I have used in compiling the above account. In the

  <p>Insects form by far the larger part of the land animals of the world; they outnumber in species
  all the other terrestrial animals together, while compared with the Vertebrates their numbers are
  simply enormous. Yet they attract but little attention from the ordinary observer, this being
  probably primarily due to the small size of the individual Insect, which leads the unreflecting to
  treat the creature as of little importance. "It can be crushed in a moment" is perhaps the
  unformulated idea that underlies the almost complete neglect of knowledge concerning Insects that
  prevails even in the educated classes of society. The largest Insects scarcely exceed in bulk a
  mouse or a wren, while the smallest are almost or quite imperceptible to the naked eye, and yet
  the larger part of the animal matter existing on the lands of the globe is in all probability
  locked up in the forms of Insects. Taken as a whole they are the most successful of all the forms
  of terrestrial animals.</p>

  <p>In the waters of the globe the predominance of Insect life disappears. In the smaller
  collections of fresh water many Insects find a home during a portion of their lives, and some few
  contrive to pass their whole existence in such places; but of the larger bodies of fresh water
  they invade merely the fringes, and they make only the feeblest attempt at existence in the ocean;
  the genus <i>Halobates</i> containing, so far as we know, the sole Insects <span class="pagenum"
  id="page84"><span class="smaller">{84}</span></span>that are capable of using the ocean as a
  medium of existence at a distance from the shore.</p>

  <p>It will probably be asked, how has it come about that creatures so insignificant in size and
  strength have nevertheless been so successful in what we call the struggle for existence? And it
  is possible that the answer will be found in the peculiar relations that exist in Insects between
  the great functions of circulation and respiration; these being of such a nature that the
  nutrition of the organs of the body can be carried on very rapidly and very efficiently so long as
  a certain bulk is not exceeded.</p>

  <p>Rapidity of growth is carried to an almost incredible extent in some Insects, and the powers of
  multiplication&mdash;which may be considered as equivalent to the growth of the species&mdash;even
  surpass the rapidity of the increase of the individual; while, as if to augment the favourable
  results attainable by the more usual routine of the physiological processes, "metamorphosis" has
  been adopted, as a consequence of which growth and development can be isolated from one another,
  thus allowing the former to go on unchecked or uncomplicated by the latter. A very simple
  calculation will show how favourable some of the chief features of Insect life are. Let it be
  supposed that growth of the individual takes time in proportion to the bulk attained, and let A be
  an animal that weighs one ounce, B a creature that weighs ten ounces, each having the power of
  producing 100 young when full grown; a simple calculation shows that after the lapse of a time
  necessary for the production of one generation of the larger creature the produce of the smaller
  animal will enormously outweigh that of its bulkier rival. Probably it was some consideration of
  this sort that led Linnaeus to make his somewhat paradoxical statement to the effect that three
  flies consume the carcase of a horse as quickly as a lion.<a id="NtA_16"
  href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Astonishing as may be the rapidity of the physiological processes of Insects, the results
  attained by them are, it must be admitted, scarcely less admirable: the structures of the Insect's
  body exhibit a perfection that, from a mechanical point of view, is unsurpassed, while the
  external beauty of some of the creatures makes them fit associates of the most delicate flowers or
  no mean rivals of the most gorgeous of the feathered world. The words <span class="pagenum"
  id="page85"><span class="smaller">{85}</span></span>of Linnaeus, "Natura in minimis maxime
  miranda," are not a mere rhetorical effort, but the expression of a simple truth. Saint Augustine,
  too, though speaking from a point of view somewhat remote from that of the great Swedish
  naturalist, expressed an idea that leads to a similar conclusion when he said, "Creavit in coelum
  angelos, in terram vermiculos; nec major in illis nec minor in istis."</p>

  <p>The formation of organised societies by some kinds of Insects is a phenomenon of great
  interest, for there are very few animals except man and Insects that display this method of
  existence. Particulars as to some of these societies will be given when we treat of the
  Termitidae, and of the Hymenoptera Aculeata; but we will take this opportunity of directing
  attention to some points of general interest in connexion with this subject. In Insect societies
  we find that not only do great numbers of separate individuals live together and adopt different
  modes of industrial action in accordance with the position they occupy in the association, but
  also that such individuals are profoundly modified in the structures of their body and in their
  physiological processes in such ways as to specially fit them for the parts they have to play. We
  may also see these societies in what may be considered different stages of evolution; the
  phenomena we are alluding to being in some species much less marked than they are in others, and
  these more primitive kinds of societies being composed of a smaller number of individuals, which
  are also much less different from one another. We, moreover, meet with complex societies
  exhibiting some remarkably similar features among Insects that are very different systematically.
  The true ants and the white ants belong to groups that are in structure and in the mode of growth
  of the individual essentially dissimilar, though their social lives are in several important
  respects analogous.</p>

  <p>It should be remarked that the phenomena connected with the social life of Insects are still
  only very imperfectly known; many highly important points being quite obscure, and our ideas being
  too much based on fragments gathered from the lives of different species. The honey bee is the
  only social Insect of whose economy we have anything approaching to a wide knowledge, and even in
  the case of this Insect our information is neither so complete nor so precise as is desirable.</p>

  <p>The various branches of knowledge connected with Insects <span class="pagenum"
  id="page86"><span class="smaller">{86}</span></span>are called collectively Entomology. Although
  entomology is only a department of the great science of zoology, yet it is in practice a very
  distinct one; owing to its vast extent few of those who work at other branches of zoology also
  occupy themselves with entomology, while entomologists usually confine themselves to work in the
  vast field thus abandoned to them.</p>

  <p>Before passing to the consideration of the natural history and structure of the members of the
  various Orders of Insects we will give a verbal diagrammatic sketch, if we may use such an
  expression, with a view to explaining the various terms that are ordinarily used. We shall make it
  as brief as possible, taking in succession (1) the external structure, (2) internal structure, (3)
  development of the individual, (4) classification.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In the course of this introductory sketch we shall find it necessary to mention the
  names of some of the Orders of Insects that will only be explained or defined in subsequent pages.
  We may therefore here state that the term "Orthoptera" includes grasshoppers, locusts, earwigs,
  cockroaches; "Neuroptera" comprises dragon-flies, May-flies, lacewings, stone-flies and
  caddis-flies; to the "Hymenoptera" belong bees, wasps, ants, sawflies, and a host of little
  creatures scarcely noticed by the ordinary observer: "Coleoptera" are beetles; "Lepidoptera,"
  butterflies and moths; "Diptera," house-flies, blue-bottles, daddy-longlegs, and such; "Hemiptera"
  or "Rhynchota" are bugs, greenfly, etc.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Class Insecta: or Insecta Hexapoda.</b></p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Definition</i>.&mdash;Insects are small animals, having the body divided into
  three regions placed in longitudinal succession&mdash;head, thorax, and abdomen: they take in air
  by means of tracheae, a system of tubes distributed throughout the body, and opening externally by
  means of orifices placed at the sides of the body. They have six legs, and a pair of antennae;
  these latter are placed on the head, while the legs are attached to the thorax, or second of the
  three great body divisions; the abdomen has no true legs, but not infrequently has terminal
  appendages and, on the under surface, protuberances which serve as feet. Very frequently there are
  two pairs of wings, sometimes only one pair, in other cases none: the wings are always placed on
  the thorax. Insects are transversely segmented&mdash;that is to say, the body has the form of a
  succession of <span class="pagenum" id="page87"><span class="smaller">{87}</span></span>rings; but
  this condition is in many cases obscure; the number of these rings rarely, if ever, exceeds
  thirteen in addition to the head and to a terminal piece that sometimes exists. Insects usually
  change much in appearance in the course of their growth, the annulose or ringed condition being
  most evident in the early part of the individual's life. The legs are usually elongate and
  apparently jointed, but in the immature condition may be altogether absent, or very short; in the
  latter case the jointing is obscure. The number of jointed legs is always six.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>External Structure.</b></p>

  <p>The series of rings of which the external crust or skeleton of Insects is composed exhibits
  great modifications, not only in the various kinds of Insects but even in the different parts of
  the same individual, and at successive periods of its development; so that in the majority of
  mature Insects the separate rings are readily distinguished only in the hind body or abdomen. The
  total number of the visible rings, segments, somites, or arthromeres, as they are variously called
  by different writers, is frequently thirteen in addition to the head. This latter part is
  considered to be itself composed of the elements of several rings, but morphologists are not yet
  agreed as to their number, some thinking this is three while others place it as high as seven;
  three or four being, perhaps, the figures at present most in favour, though Viallanes, who has
  recently discussed<a id="NtA_17" href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> the subject, considers six, the
  number suggested by Huxley, as the most probable. Cholodkovsky is of a similar opinion. However
  this may be, the three rings behind the head constitute the thorax, which is always largely
  developed, though, like the head, its segmentation is usually very much obscured by unequal
  development of different parts, or by consolidation of some of them, or by both of these
  conditions. The third great division of the body, the abdomen, is also usually much modified by
  one or more of the terminal segments being changed in form, or even entirely withdrawn into the
  interior of the body. The existence of ten segments in the hind body can, however, be very
  frequently actually demonstrated, so that it is correct to speak of ten as the normal number.</p>

  <p>It is no reproach to morphologists that they have not yet agreed as to the number of segments
  that may be taken as typical for an Insect, for all the branches of evidence bearing on the point
  are still imperfect. It may be well, therefore, to state the most extreme views that appear to be
  at all admissible. Hagen<a id="NtA_18" href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> has recently stated the
  opinion that each thoracic segment consists really of three segments&mdash;an anterior or
  wing-bearer, a middle or leg-bearer, and a posterior or stigma-bearer. There seems to be no reason
  for treating the stigma as being at all of the nature of an appendage, and the theory of a triple
  origin for these segments may be dismissed. There are, however, several facts that indicate a
  duplicity in these somites, among which we may specially mention the remarkable constancy of two
  pleural pieces on each side of each thoracic segment. The hypothesis of these rings being each the
  representative of two segments cannot therefore be at present considered entirely untenable, and
  in that case the maximum and minimum numbers that can be suggested appear to be twenty-four and
  eleven, distributed as follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Although it is not probable that ultimately so great a difference as these figures indicate
  will be found to prevail, it is certainly at present premature to say that all Insects are made up
  of the same number of primary segments.</p>

  <p>A brief account of the structure of the integument will be found in the chapter dealing with
  the post-embryonic development.</p>

  <p>The three great regions of the Insect body are functionally as well as anatomically distinct.
  The head bears the most important of the sense organs, viz. the antennae and ocular organs; it
  includes the greater of the nerve-centres, and carries the mouth as well as the appendages, the
  trophi, connected therewith. The thorax is chiefly devoted to the organs of locomotion, bearing
  externally the wings and legs, and including considerable masses of muscles, as well as the nerve
  centres by which they are innervated; through the thorax there pass, however, in the longitudinal
  direction, those structures by which the unity of the organisation is completed, viz. the
  alimentary canal, the dorsal vessel or "heart" for distributing the nutritive fluid, and also the
  nerve cords. The abdomen includes the greater part of the organs for carrying on the life of the
  individual and of the species; it also frequently bears externally, at or near its termination,
  appendages that are doubtless usually organs of sense of a tactile nature.</p>

  <p>In the lower forms of Insect life there is little or no actual internal triple division of the
  body; but in the higher forms such separation becomes wonderfully complete, so that the head may
  communicate with the thorax only by a narrow isthmus, and the thorax with the abdomen only by a
  very slender link. This arrangement is carried to its greatest extreme in the Hymenoptera
  Aculeata. It may be looked on as possibly a means for separating the nutrition of the parts
  included in the three great body divisions.</p>

  <p>Along each side of the body extends a series of orifices for the admission of air, the stigmata
  or spiracles; there are none of these on the head, but on each side of most of the other segments
  <span class="pagenum" id="page90"><span class="smaller">{90}</span></span>there is one of these
  spiracles. This, however, is a rule subject to many exceptions, and it is doubtful whether there
  is ever a spiracle on the last abdominal segment. Even in the young stage of the Insect the number
  of these stigmata is variable; while in the perfect Insect the positions of some of the stigmata
  may be much modified correlatively with the unequal development or consolidation of parts,
  especially of the thorax when it is highly modified for bearing the wings.</p>

  <p>The segments of the Insect are not separate parts connected with one another by joints and
  ligaments; the condition of the Insect crust is in fact that of a continuous long sac, in which
  there are slight constrictions giving rise to the segments, the interior of the sac being always
  traversed from end to end by a tube, or rather by the invaginated ends of the sac itself which
  connect with an included second sac, the stomach. The more prominent or exposed parts of the
  external sac are more or less hard, while the constricted parts remain delicate, and thus the
  continuous bag comes to consist of a series of more or less hard rings connected by more delicate
  membranes. This condition is readily seen in distended larvae, and is shown by our figure 48 which
  is taken from the same specimen, whose portrait, drawn during life, will be given when we come to
  the Coleoptera, family Cleridae. The nature of the concealed connexions between the apparently
  separate segments of Insects is shown at <i>m</i>, Fig. 47, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page88">88</a></span>.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      larva.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>As the number of segments in the adult Insect corresponds&mdash;except in the head&mdash;with
  the number of divisions that appear very early in the embryo, we conclude that the segmentation of
  the adult is, even in Insects which change their form very greatly during growth, due to the
  condition that existed in the embryo; but it must not be forgotten that important secondary
  changes occur in the somites during the growth and development of the individual. Hence in some
  cases there appear to be more than the usual number of segments, e.g. <i>Cardiophorus</i> larva,
  and in others the number of somites is diminished by <span class="pagenum" id="page91"><span
  class="smaller">{91}</span></span>amalgamation, or by the extreme reduction in size of some of the
  parts.</p>

  <p>Besides the division of the body into consecutive segments, another feature is usually
  conspicuous; the upper part, in many segments, being differentiated from the lower and the two
  being connected together by intervening parts in somewhat the same sort of way as the segments
  themselves are connected. Such a differentiation is never visible on the head, but may frequently
  be seen in the thorax, and almost always in the abdomen. A dorsal and a ventral aspect are thus
  separated, while the connecting bond on either side forms a pleuron. By this differentiation a
  second form of symmetry is introduced, for whereas there is but one upper and one lower aspect,
  and the two do not correspond, there are two lateral and similar areas. This bilateral symmetry is
  conspicuous in nearly all the external parts of the body, and extends to most of the internal
  organs. The pleura, or lateral regions of the sac, frequently remain membranous when the dorsal
  and ventral aspects are hard. The dorsal parts of the Insect's rings are also called by writers
  terga, or nota, and the ventral parts sterna.</p>

  <p>The appendages of the body are:&mdash;(1) a pair of antennae; (2) the trophi, constituted by
  three pairs of mouth-parts; (3) three pairs of legs; (4) the wings<a id="NtA_19"
  href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>; (5) abdominal appendages of various kinds, but usually jointed.
  Before considering these in detail we shall do well to make ourselves more fully acquainted with
  the elementary details of the structure of the trunk.</p>

  <p>In the adult Insect the integument or crust of the body is more or less hard or shell-like,
  sometimes, indeed, very hard, and on examination it will be seen that besides the divisions into
  segments and into dorsal, ventral, and pleural regions, there are lines indicating the existence
  of other divisions, and it will be found that by dissection along these lines distinct pieces can
  be readily separated. Each hard piece that can be so separated is called a sclerite, and the
  individual sclerites of a segment have received names from entomotomists. The sclerites are not
  really <span class="pagenum" id="page92"><span class="smaller">{92}</span></span>quite separate
  pieces, though we are in the habit of speaking of them as if such were the case. If an Insect be
  distended by pressure from the interior, many of the sclerites can be forced apart, and it is then
  seen that they are connected by delicate membrane. The structure is thus made up of hard parts
  meeting one another along certain lines of union&mdash;sutures&mdash;so that the original
  membranous continuity may be quite concealed. In many Insects, or in parts of them, the sclerites
  do not come into apposition by sutures, and are thus, as it were, islands of hard matter
  surrounded by membrane. A brief consideration of some of the more important sclerites is all that
  is necessary for our present purpose: we will begin with the head.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The head is most variable in size and form; as a part of its surface is occupied by the eyes
  and as these organs differ in shape, extent, and position to a surprising degree, it is not a
  matter for astonishment that it is almost impossible to agree as to terms for the areas of the
  head. Of the sclerites of the head itself there are only three that are sufficiently constant and
  definite to be worthy of description here. These are the clypeus, the epicranium, and the gula.
  The clypeus is situate on the upper surface of the head-capsule, in front; it bears the labrum
  which may be briefly described as a sort of flap forming an upper lip. The labrum is usually
  possessed of some amount of mobility. The clypeus itself is excessively variable in size and form,
  and sometimes cannot be delimited owing to the obliteration of the suture of connexion with the
  more posterior part of the head; it is rarely or never a paired piece. Occasionally there is a
  more or less distinct piece interposed between the clypeus and the labrum, and which is the source
  of considerable difficulty, as it may be taken for the clypeus. Some authors call the clypeus the
  epistome, but it is better to use this latter term for the purpose of indicating the part that is
  immediately behind the labrum, whether that part be the clypeus, or some other sclerite; the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page93"><span class="smaller">{93}</span></span>term is very convenient in
  those cases where the structure cannot be, or has not been, satisfactorily determined
  morphologically.</p>

  <p>In Figure 50 the parts usually visible on the anterior aspect of the head and its appendages
  are shown so far as these latter can be seen when the mouth is closed; in the case of the Insect
  here represented the bases of the mandibles are clearly seen (<i>g</i>), while their apical
  portions are entirely covered by the labrum, just below the lower margin of which the tips of the
  maxillae are seen, looking as if they were the continuations of the mandibles.</p>

  <p>The labrum is a somewhat perplexing piece, morphologists being not yet agreed as to its nature;
  it is usually placed quite on the front of the head, and varies extremely in form; it is nearly
  always a single or unpaired piece; the French morphologist Chatin considers that it is really a
  paired structure.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The gula (Fig. 49, B <i>d</i>, and Fig. 47, <i>z</i>) is a piece existing in the middle
  longitudinally of the under-surface of the head; in front it bears the mentum or the submentum,
  and extends backwards to the great occipital foramen, but in some Insects the gula is in front
  very distant from the edge of the buccal cavity. The epicranium forms the larger part of the head,
  and is consequently most inconstant in size and shape; it usually occupies the larger part of the
  upper-surface, and is reflected to the under-surface to meet the gula. Sometimes a transverse line
  exists (Fig. 49, A) dividing the epicranium into two parts, the posterior of which has been called
  the protocranium; which, however, is not a good term. The epicranium bears the antennae; these
  organs do not come out between the epicranium and the clypeus, the foramen for their insertion
  being seated entirely in the epicranium (see Fig. 50). In some Insects there are traces of the
  epicranium being divided longitudinally along the middle line. When this part is much modified the
  antennae may appear to be inserted on the lateral portions of the head, or even <span
  class="pagenum" id="page94"><span class="smaller">{94}</span></span>on its under-side; this arises
  from extension of some part of the epicranium, as shown in Fig. 49, B, where <i>h</i>, the cavity
  of insertion of the antenna, appears to be situate on the under-surface of the epicranium, the
  appearance being due to an infolding of an angle of the part.</p>

  <p>There is always a gap in the back of the head for the passage of the alimentary canal and other
  organs into the thorax; this opening is called the occipital foramen. Various terms, such as
  frons, vertex, occiput, temples, and cheeks, have been used for designating areas of the head. The
  only one of these which is of importance is the gena, and even this can only be defined as the
  anterior part of the lateral portion of the head-capsule. An extended study of the comparative
  anatomy of the head-capsule is still a desideratum in entomology. The appendages of the head that
  are engaged in the operations of feeding are frequently spoken of collectively as the trophi, a
  term which includes the labrum as well as the true buccal appendages.</p>

  <p>The appendages forming the parts of the mouth are paired, and consist of the mandibles, the
  maxillae, and the labium, the pair in this latter part being combined to form a single body. The
  buccal appendages are frequently spoken of as gnathites. The gnathites are some, if not all, of
  them composed of apparently numerous parts, some of these being distinct sclerites, others
  membranous structures which may be either bare or pubescent&mdash;that is, covered with delicate
  short hair. In Insects the mouth functions in two quite different ways, by biting or by sucking.
  The Insects that bite are called Mandibulata, and those that suck Haustellata. In the mandibulate
  Insects the composition of the gnathites is readily comprehensible, so that in nearly the whole of
  the vast number of species of that type the corresponding parts can be recognised with something
  like certainty. This, however, is not the case with the sucking Insects; in them the parts of the
  mouth are very different indeed, so that in some cases morphologists are not agreed as to what
  parts really correspond with some of the structures of the Mandibulata. At present it will be
  sufficient for us to consider only the mandibulate mouth, leaving the various forms of sucking
  mouth to be discussed when we treat of the Orders of Haustellata in detail.</p>

  <p>The upper or anterior pair of gnathites is the mandibles, (Fig. 50, <i>g</i>). There is no part
  of the body that varies more than <span class="pagenum" id="page95"><span
  class="smaller">{95}</span></span>does the mandible, even in the mandibulate Insects. It can
  scarcely be detected in some, while in others, as in the male stag-beetle, it may attain the
  length of the whole of the rest of the body; its form, too, varies as much as its size; most
  usually, however, the pair of mandibles are somewhat of the form of callipers, and are used for
  biting, cutting, holding, or crushing purposes. The mandibles are frequently armed with processes
  spoken of as teeth, but which must not be in any way confounded with the teeth of Vertebrates. The
  only Insects that possess an articulated tooth are the Passalidae, beetles armed with a rather
  large mandible bearing a single mobile tooth among others that are not so. Wood Mason and Chatin
  consider the mandibles to be, morphologically, jointed appendages, and the latter authority states
  that in the mandible of <i>Embia</i> he has been able to distinguish the same elements as exist in
  the maxillae. In aculeate Hymenoptera the mandibles are used to a considerable extent for
  industrial purposes.</p>

      <i>Locusta viridissima</i>: <b>A</b>, mandibles; <b>B</b>, maxillae (lateral parts) and labium

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The maxilla is a complex organ consisting of numerous pieces, viz. cardo, stipes, palpiger,
  galea, lacinia, palpus. The galea and lacinia are frequently called the lobes of the maxilla. The
  maxilla no doubt acts as a sense organ as well as a mechanical apparatus for holding; this latter
  function being subordinate to the other. In Fig. 68, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page122">122</a></span>, we have represented a complex maxillary sense-organ.</p>

  <p>The labium or lower lip has as its basal portion the <span class="pagenum" id="page96"><span
  class="smaller">{96}</span></span>undivided mentum, and closes the mouth beneath or behind,
  according as the position of the head varies. In most Insects the labium appears very different
  from the maxilla, but in many cases several of the parts corresponding to those of the maxilla can
  be clearly traced in the labium.</p>

      ligula; <i>f</i>, paraglossa.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The mentum is an undivided, frequently very hard, piece, continuous with either the submentum
  or the gula, and anterior to this are placed the other parts, viz. the labial palpi and their
  supports, the palpigers; beyond and between these exists a central piece (Fig. 52, B, <i>e</i>),
  about whose name some difference of opinion prevails, but which may be called the ligula
  (languette of French authors), and on each side of this is a paraglossa. In the Orthoptera the
  single median piece&mdash;the ligula of Coleopterists&mdash;is represented by two divided parts.
  In some Insects (many Coleoptera) there is interposed between the mentum and the palpigers a piece
  called the hypoglottis (Fig. 52, B, <i>b</i>). It is not so well ascertained as it should be, that
  the pieces of the lower lip bearing the same names in different Orders are in all cases really
  homologous, and comparison suggests that the hypoglottis of Coleoptera may possibly represent the
  piece corresponding to the mentum of Orthopterists, the so-called mentum of beetles being in that
  case the submentum of Orthopterists.</p>

  <p>There is another part of the mouth to which we may call special attention, as it has recently
  attracted more attention than it formerly did; it is a membranous lobe in the interior of the
  mouth, very conspicuous in Orthoptera, and called the tongue, lingua, or hypopharynx; it reposes,
  in the interior of the mouth (Fig. 51, <i>o</i>), on the middle parts of the front of the labium;
  it is probably not entirely lost in Coleoptera, but enters into the composition of the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page97"><span class="smaller">{97}</span></span>complex middle part of the lip
  by amalgamation with the paraglossae. It has recently been proposed to treat this lingua as the
  morphological equivalent of the labium or of the maxillae, giving it the name of the endolabium,
  but the propriety of this course remains to be proved;<a id="NtA_20"
  href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> the view is apparently suggested chiefly by the structure of the
  mouth of <i>Hemimerus</i>, a very rare and most peculiar Insect that has not as yet been
  sufficiently studied.</p>

  <p>As the maxillae and labium are largely used by taxonomists in the systematic arrangement of the
  mandibulate Insects, we give a figure of them as seen in Coleoptera, where the parts, though
  closely amalgamated, can nevertheless be distinguished. This Fig. 52 should be compared with Fig.
  51.</p>

  <p>In speaking of the segments of the body we pointed out that they were not separate parts but
  constituted an uninterrupted whole, and it is well to remark here that this is also true of the
  gnathites. Although the mouth parts are spoken of as separate pieces, they really form only
  projections from the great body wall. Fig. 51, B, shows the intimate connexion that exists between
  the maxillae and labium; the continuity of the mandibles with the membrane of the buccal cavity is
  capable of very easy demonstration.</p>

  <p>The head bears, besides the pieces we have considered, a pair of antennae. These organs, though
  varying excessively in form, are always present in the adult Insect, and exist even in the
  majority of young Insects. They are very mobile, highly sensitive organs, situate on or near the
  front part of the head. The antennae arise in the embryo from the procephalic lobes, the
  morphological import of which parts is one of the most difficult points connected with Insect
  embryology.</p>

  <p>The eyes of Insects are of two sorts, simple and compound. The simple eyes, or ocelli, vary in
  number from one to as many as eighteen or twenty; when thus numerous they are situated in groups
  on each side of the head. In their most perfect form, as found in adult aculeate Hymenoptera, in
  Orthoptera and Diptera, ocelli are usually two or three in number, and present the appearance of
  small, perfectly transparent lenses inserted in the integument. In their simplest form they are
  said to consist of some masses of pigment in connexion with a nerve.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The compound, or facetted, eyes are the most remarkable of all the structures of the Insect,
  and in the higher and more active forms, such as the Dragon-flies and hovering Diptera, attain a
  complexity and delicacy of organisation that elicit the highest admiration from every one who
  studies them. They are totally different in structure and very distinct in function from the eyes
  of Vertebrata, and are seated on very large special lobes of the brain (see Fig. 65), which indeed
  are so large and so complex in structure that Insects may be described as possessing special
  ocular brains brought into relation with the lights, shades, and movements of the external world
  by a remarkably complex optical apparatus. This instrumental part of the eye is called the
  dioptric part in contradistinction from the percipient portion, and consists of an outer corneal
  lens (<i>a</i>, Fig. 53), whose exposed surface forms one of the facets of the eye; under the lens
  is placed the crystalline cone (<i>b</i>), this latter being borne on a rod-like object
  (<i>c</i>), called the rhabdom. There are two layers of pigment, the outer (<i>e</i>), called the
  iris-pigment, the inner (<i>f</i>), the retinal-pigment; underneath, or rather we should say more
  central than, the rhabdoms is the fenestrate membrane (<i>d</i>), beyond which there is an
  extremely complex mass of nerve-fibres; nerves also penetrate the fenestrate membrane, and their
  distal extremities are connected with the delicate sheaths by one of which each rhabdom is
  surrounded, the combination of sheath and nerves forming a retinula. Each set of the parts above
  the fenestrate membrane constitutes an ommatidium, and there may be many of these ommatidia in an
  eye; indeed, it is said that the eye of a small beetle, <i>Mordella</i>, contains as many as
  25,000 ommatidia. As a rule the larvae of Insects with a complete metamorphosis bear only simple
  eyes. In the young of Dragon-flies, as well as of some other Insects having a less perfect
  metamorphosis, the compound eyes exist in the early stages, but they <span class="pagenum"
  id="page99"><span class="smaller">{99}</span></span>have then an obscure appearance, and are
  probably functionally imperfect.</p>

  <p>In the interior of the head there exists a horny framework called the tentorium, whose chief
  office apparently is to protect the brain. It is different in kind according to the species. The
  head shows a remarkable and unique relation to the following segments. It is the rule in Insect
  structure that the back of a segment overlaps the front part of the one following it; in other
  words, each segment receives within it the front of the one behind it. Though this is one of the
  most constant features of Insect anatomy, it is departed from in the case of the head, which may
  be either received into, or overlapped by, the segment following it, but never itself overlaps the
  latter. There is perhaps but a single Insect (<i>Hypocephalus</i>, an anomalous beetle) in which
  the relation between the head and thorax can be considered to be at all similar to that which
  exists between each of the other segments of the body and that following it; and even in
  <i>Hypocephalus</i> it is only the posterior angles of the head that overlap the thorax. Although
  the head usually appears to be very closely connected with the thorax, and is very frequently in
  repose received to a considerable extent within the latter, it nevertheless enjoys great freedom
  of motion; this is obtained by means of a large membrane, capable of much corrugation, and in
  which there are seated some sclerites, so arranged as to fold together and occupy little space
  when the head is retracted, but which help to prop and support it when extended for feeding or
  other purposes. These pieces are called the cervical sclerites or plates. They are very largely
  developed in Hymenoptera, in many Coleoptera, and in Blattid&aelig;, and have not yet received from
  anatomists a sufficient amount of attention. Huxley suggested that they may be portions of head
  segments.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Thorax.</b></p>

  <p>The thorax, being composed of the three consecutive rings behind the head, falls naturally into
  three divisions&mdash;pro-, meso-, <span class="pagenum" id="page100"><span
  class="smaller">{100}</span></span>and metathorax. These three segments differ greatly in their
  relative proportions in different Insects, and in different stages of the same Insect's life. In
  their more highly developed conditions each of the three divisions is of complex structure, and
  the sclerites of which it is externally made up are sufficiently constant in their numbers and
  relative positions to permit of their identification in a vast number of cases; hence the
  sclerites have received names, and their nomenclature is of practical importance, because some, if
  not all, of these parts are made use of in the classification of Insects. Each division of the
  thorax has an upper region, called synonymically dorsum, notum, or tergum; an inferior or ventral
  region, called sternum; and on each side a lateral region, the pleuron. These regions of each of
  the three thoracic divisions are further distinguished by joining to their name an indication of
  the segment spoken of, in the form of the prefixes pro-, meso-, and meta-; thus the pronotum,
  prosternum, and propleura make up the prothorax. The thoracic regions are each made up of
  sclerites whose nomenclature is due to Audouin.<a id="NtA_21" href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> He
  considered that every thoracic ring is composed of the pieces shown in Fig. 55, viz. (1) the
  sternum (B', <i>a</i>), an unpaired ventral piece; (2) the notum (A), composed of four pieces
  placed in consecutive longitudinal order (A'), and named praescutum (<i>a</i>), scutum (<i>b</i>),
  scutellum (<i>c</i>), and post-scutellum (<i>d</i>); (3) lateral pieces, of which he distinguished
  on each side an episternum (B', <i>c</i>), epimeron (<i>e</i>), and parapteron (<i>d</i>), these
  together forming the pleuron. We give Audouin's Figure, but we cannot enter on a full discussion
  of his views as to the thorax; they have become widely known, though the constancy of the parts is
  not so great as he supposed it would prove to be. Sometimes it is impossible to find all the
  elements he thought should be present in a thoracic ring, while in other cases too many sclerites
  exist. As a rule the notum of the meso- and metathoraces is in greater part composed of two
  pieces, the scutum and the scutellum; while in the pronotum only one dorsal piece can be
  satisfactorily distinguished, though a study of the development may show that really two are
  frequently, if not usually, present. On the other hand, one, or more, of the notal sclerites in
  some cases shows evidence of longitudinal division along the middle. The sternum or ventral piece,
  though varying greatly in form, is <span class="pagenum" id="page101"><span
  class="smaller">{101}</span></span>the most constant element of a thoracic segment, but it has
  sometimes the appearance of consisting of two parts, an anterior and a posterior. The pleuron
  nearly always consists quite evidently of two parts, the episternum, the more anterior and
  inferior, and the epimeron.<a id="NtA_22" href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> The relations between
  these two parts vary much; in some cases the episternum is conspicuously the more anterior, while
  in others the epimeron is placed much above it, and may extend nearly as far forwards as it. It
  may be said, as a rule, that when the sternum extends farther backwards than the notum, the
  epimeron is above the episternum, as in many Coleoptera; but if the sternum be anterior to the
  notum, then the episternum is superior to the epimeron, as in dragon-flies. We would here again
  reiterate the fact that these "pieces" are really not separate parts, but are more or less
  indurated portions of a continuous integument, which is frequently entirely occupied by them;
  hence a portion of a sclerite that in one species is hard, may in an allied form be wholly or
  partly membranous, and in such case its delimitation may be very evident on some of its sides, and
  quite obscure on another.</p>

  <p>The parapteron of Audouin does not appear to be really a distinct portion of the pleuron; in
  the case of <i>Dytiscus</i> it is apparently merely a thickening of an edge. Audouin supposed this
  part to be specially connected with the wing-articulation, and the term has been subsequently used
  by other writers in connexion with several little pieces that exist in the pleural region of
  winged Insects.</p>

  <p>The prothorax is even more subject to variation in its development than the other divisions of
  the thorax are. In the Hymenoptera the prosternum is disconnected from the pronotum and is
  capable, together with the first pair of legs, of movement independent of its corresponding dorsal
  part, the pronotum, which in this Order is always more or less completely united with the
  meso-thorax; in the Diptera the rule is that the three thoracic segments are closely consolidated
  into one mass. In the majority of Insects the prothorax is comparatively free, that is to say, it
  is not so closely united with the other two thoracic segments as they are with one another. The
  three thoracic rings are seen in a comparatively uniform state of development in a great number of
  larvae; also in the adult stages of some Aptera, and among winged insects in some Neuroptera such
  as the Embiidae, Termitidae, and Perlidae. In Lepidoptera the pronotum bears a pair of erectile
  processes called patagia; though frequently of moderately large size, they escape observation,
  being covered with scales and usually closely adpressed to the sides of the pronotum.</p>

  <p>The two great divisions of the body&mdash;the mesothorax and the metathorax&mdash;are usually
  very intimately combined in winged Insects, and even when the prothorax is free, as in Coleoptera,
  these posterior two thoracic rings are very greatly amalgamated. In the higher forms of the Order
  just mentioned the mesosternum and mesopleuron become changed in direction, and form as it were a
  diaphragm closing the front of the metasternum. The meso- and meta-thorax frequently each bear a
  pair of wings.</p>

  <p>We have described briefly and figured (Fig. 55) the sclerites of the mesothorax, and those of
  the metathorax correspond fairly well with them. In addition to the sclerites usually described as
  constituting these two thoracic divisions, there are some small pieces at the bases of the wings.
  Jurine discriminated and named no less than seven of these at the base of the anterior <span
  class="pagenum" id="page103"><span class="smaller">{103}</span></span>wing of a Hymenopteron.  One
  of them becomes of considerable size and importance in the Order just mentioned, and seems to be
  articulated so as to exert pressure on the base of the costa of the wing.  This structure attains
  its maximum of development in a genus (? nondescript) of Scoliidae, as shown in Fig. 56. The best
  name for this sclerite seems to be that proposed by Kirby and Spence, tegula.  Some writers call
  it parapt&egrave;re, hypopt&egrave;re, or squamule, and others have termed it patagium; this latter name is,
  however, inadmissible, as it is applied to a process of the prothorax we have already alluded
  to.</p>

  <p>To complete our account of the structure of the thorax it is necessary to mention certain hard
  parts projecting into its interior, but of which there is usually little or no trace externally. A
  large process in many Insects projects upwards from the sternum in a forked manner. It was called
  by Audouin the entothorax; some modern authors prefer the term apophysis. Longitudinal partitions
  of very large size, descending from the dorsum into the interior, also exist; these are called
  phragmas, and are of great importance in some Insects with perfect flight, such as Hymenoptera,
  Lepidoptera, and Diptera. There is no phragma in connection with the pronotum, but behind this
  part there may be three. A phragma has the appearance of being a fold of the dorsum; it serves as
  an attachment for muscles, and may probably be of service in other ways. More insignificant
  projections into the interior are the little pieces called apodemes (Fig. 57, <i>e</i>); these are
  placed at the sides of the thorax near the wings. The apophyses are no doubt useful in preserving
  the delicate vital organs from shocks, or from derangement by the muscular movements and the
  changes of position of the body.</p>

  <p>The appendages of the thorax are (<i>a</i>) inferior, the legs; (<i>b</i>) <span
  class="pagenum" id="page104"><span class="smaller">{104}</span></span>superior, the wings. The
  legs are always six in number, and are usually present even in larvae, though there exist many
  apodal larvae, especially in Diptera. The three pairs of legs form one of the most constant of the
  characters of Insects. They are jointed appendages and consist of foot, otherwise tarsus; tibia,
  femur, trochanter, and coxa; another piece, called trochantin more or less distinctly separated
  from the coxa, exists in many Insects. The legs are prolongations of the body sac, and are in
  closer relation with the epimera and with the episterna than with other parts of the crust, though
  they have a close relation with the sternum. If we look at the body and leg of a neuropterous
  Insect (Fig. 58) we see that the basal part of the leg&mdash;the coxa&mdash;is apparently a
  continuation of one of the two pleural pieces or of both; in the latter case one of the prolonged
  pieces forms the coxa proper, and the tip of the other forms a supporting piece, which may
  possibly be the homologue of the trochantin of some Insects. In some Orthoptera, especially in
  Blattidae, and in Termitidae, there is a transverse chitinised fold interposed between the sternum
  and the coxa, and this has the appearance of being the same piece as the trochantin of the
  anterior legs of Coleoptera.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Beyond the coxa comes the trochanter; this in many Hymenoptera is a double piece, though in
  other Insects it is single; usually it is the most insignificant part of the leg. The femur is, on
  the whole, the least variable part of the leg; the tibia, which follows it, being frequently
  highly modified for industrial or other purposes. The joint between the femur and the tibia is
  usually bent, and is therefore the most conspicuous one in the leg; it is called the knee. The
  other joints have not corresponding names, though that between the tibia and the tarsus is of
  great importance. The spines at the tip of the tibia, projecting beyond it, are called spurs, or
  calcares. The tarsus or <span class="pagenum" id="page105"><span
  class="smaller">{105}</span></span>foot is extremely variable; it is very rarely absent, but may
  consist of only one piece&mdash;joint, as it is frequently called<a id="NtA_23"
  href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>&mdash;or of any larger number up to five, which may be
  considered the characteristic number in the higher Insect forms. The terminal joint of the tarsus
  bears normally a pair of claws; between the claws there is frequently a lobe or process, according
  to circumstances very varied in different Insects, called empodium, arolium, palmula, plantula,
  pseudonychium, or pulvillus. This latter name should only be used in those cases in which the sole
  of the foot is covered with a dense pubescence. The form of the individual tarsal joints and the
  armature or vestiture of the lower surface are highly variable. The most remarkable tarsus is that
  found on the front foot of the male <i>Dytiscus</i>.</p>

  <p>It has been suggested that the claws and the terminal appendage of the tarsus ought to be
  counted as forming a distinct joint; hence some authors state that the higher Insects have six
  joints to the feet. These parts, however, are never counted as separate joints by systematic
  entomologists, and it has recently been stated that they are not such originally.</p>

  <p>The parts of the foot at the extremity of the last tarsal joint proper are of great importance
  to the creature, and vary greatly in different Insects. The most constant part of this apparatus
  is a pair of claws, or a single claw. Between the two claws there may exist the additional
  apparatus referred to above. This in some Insects&mdash;notably in the Diptera&mdash;reaches a
  very complex development. We figure these structures in <i>Pelopaeus spinolae</i>, a fossorial
  Hymenopteron, remarking that our figures exhibit the apparatus in a state of retraction (Fig. 59).
  According to the nomenclature of Dahl and Ockler<a id="NtA_24" href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
  the plate (<i>b</i>) on the dorsal aspect is the pressure plate (<i>Druck-Platte</i>), and acts as
  an agent of pressure on the sole of the pad (C, <i>e</i>); <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> on the underside
  are considered to be extension-agents; <i>c</i>, extension-plate; <i>d</i>, extension-sole
  (<i>Streck-Platte</i>, <i>Streck-Sohle</i>). These agents are assisted in acting on the pad by
  means of an elastic bow placed in the interior of the latter. The pad (<i>e</i>) is a very
  remarkable structure, capable of much extension and retraction; <span class="pagenum"
  id="page106"><span class="smaller">{106}</span></span>when extended it is seen that the pressure
  plate is bent twice at a right angle so as to form a step, the distal part of which runs along the
  upper face of the basal part of the pad; the apical portion of this latter consists of two large
  lobes, which in repose, as shown in our Figure (<i>f</i>), fall back on the pad, something in the
  fashion of the retracted claws of the cat, and conceal the pressure-plate.</p>

  <p>The mode in which Insects are able to walk on smooth perpendicular surfaces has been much
  discussed, and it appears highly probable that the method by which this is accomplished is the
  exudation of moisture from the foot; there is still, however, much to be ascertained before the
  process can be satisfactorily comprehended. The theory to the effect that the method is the
  pressure of the atmosphere acting on the foot when the sole is in perfect apposition with the
  object walked on, or when a slight vacuum is created between the two, has apparently less to
  support it.</p>

  <p>The legs of the young Insect are usually more simple than those of the adult, and in
  caterpillars they are short appendages, and only imperfectly jointed. If a young larva, with feet,
  of a beetle, such as <i>Crioceris asparagi</i> be examined, it may be seen that the leg is formed
  by protuberance of the integument, which becomes divided into parts by simple creases; an
  observation suggesting that the more highly developed jointed leg is formed in a similar manner.
  This appears to be really the case, <span class="pagenum" id="page107"><span
  class="smaller">{107}</span></span>for the actual continuity of the limb at the chief
  joint&mdash;the knee&mdash;can be demonstrated in many Insects by splitting the outer integument
  longitudinally and then pulling the pieces a little apart; while in other cases even this is not
  necessary, the knee along its inner face being membranous to a considerable extent, and the
  membrane continuous from femur to tibia.</p>

  <p>Turning to the wings, we remark that there may be one or two pairs of these appendages. When
  there is but one pair it is nearly always mesothoracic, when there are two pairs one is invariably
  mesothoracic, the other metathoracic. The situation of the wing is always at the edge of the
  notum, but the attachment varies in other respects. It may be limited to a small spot, and this is
  usually the case with the anterior wing; or the attachment may extend for a considerable distance
  along the edge of the notum, a condition which frequently occurs, especially in the case of the
  posterior wings. The actual connexion of the wings with the thorax takes place by means of strong
  horny lines in them which come into very close relation with the little pieces in the thorax which
  we have already described, and which were styled by Audouin articulatory epidemes. There is
  extreme variety in the size, form, texture, and clothing of the wings, but there is so much
  resemblance in general characters amongst the members of each one of the Orders, that it is
  usually possible for an expert, seeing only a wing, to say with certainty what Order of Insects
  its possessor belonged to. We shall allude to these characters in treating of the Orders of
  Insects.</p>

  <p>Each wing consists of two layers, an upper and a lower, and between them there may be tracheae
  and other structures, especially obvious when the wings are newly developed. It has been shown by
  Hagen that the two layers can be separated when the wings are recently formed, and it is then seen
  that each layer is traversed by lines of harder matter, the nervures. These ribs are frequently
  called wing-veins, or nerves, but as they have no relation to the anatomical structures bearing
  those names, it is better to make use of the term nervures. The strength, number, form and
  inter-relations of these nervures vary exceedingly; they are thus most important aids in the
  classification of Insects. Hence various efforts have been made to establish a system of
  nomenclature that shall be uniform throughout the different Orders, but at present success has not
  <span class="pagenum" id="page108"><span class="smaller">{108}</span></span>attended these
  efforts, and it is probable that no real homology exists between the nervures of the different
  Orders of Insects. We shall not therefore discuss the question here. We may, however, mention that
  German savants have recently distinguished two forms of nervures which they consider essentially
  distinct, viz. convex and concave. These, to some extent, alternate with one another, but a fork
  given off by a convex one is not considered to be a concave one. The terms convex and concave are
  not happily chosen; they do not refer to the shape of the nervures, but appear to have been
  suggested by the fact that the surface of the wing being somewhat undulating the convex veins more
  usually run along the ridges, the concave veins along the depressions. The convex are the more
  important of the two, being the stronger, and more closely connected with the articulation of the
  wing.</p>

  <p>The wings, broadly speaking, may be said to be three-margined: the margin that is anterior when
  the wings are extended is called the costa, and the edge that is then most distant from the body
  is the outer margin, while the limit that lies along the body when the wings are closed is the
  inner margin.</p>

  <p>The only great Order of Insects provided with a single pair of wings is the Diptera, and in
  these the metathorax possesses, instead of wings, a pair of little capitate bodies called halteres
  or poisers. In the abnormal Strepsiptera, where a large pair of wings is placed on the metathorax,
  there are on the mesothorax some small appendages that are considered to represent the anterior
  wings. In the great Order Coleoptera, or beetles, the anterior wings are replaced by a pair of
  horny sheaths that close together over the back of the Insect, concealing the hind-wings, so that
  the beetle looks like a wingless Insect: in other four-winged Insects it is usually the front
  wings that are most useful in flight, but the elytra, as these parts are called in Coleoptera,
  take no active part in flight, and it has been recently suggested by Hoffbauer<a id="NtA_25"
  href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> that they are not the homologues of the front wings, but of the
  tegulae (see Fig. 56), of other Insects. In the Orthoptera the front wings also differ in
  consistence from the other pair over which they lie in repose, and are called tegmina. There are
  many Insects in which the wings <span class="pagenum" id="page109"><span
  class="smaller">{109}</span></span>exist in a more or less rudimentary or vestigial condition,
  though they are never used for purposes of flight.</p>

  <p>The abdomen, or hind body, is the least modified part of the body, though some of the numerous
  rings of which it is composed may be extremely altered from the usual simple form. Such change
  takes place at its two extremities, but usually to a much greater extent at the distal extremity
  than at the base. This latter part is attached to the thorax, and it is a curious fact that in
  many Insects the base of the abdomen is so closely connected with the thorax that it has all the
  appearance of being a portion of this latter division of the body; indeed it is sometimes
  difficult to trace the real division between the two parts. In such cases a further
  differentiation may occur, and the part of the abdomen that on its anterior aspect is intimately
  attached to the thorax may on its posterior aspect be very slightly connected with the rest of the
  abdomen. Under such circumstances it is difficult at first sight to recognise the real state of
  the case. When a segment is thus transferred from the abdomen to the metathorax, the part is
  called a median segment. The most remarkable median segment exists in those Hymenoptera which have
  a stalked abdomen, but a similar though less perfect condition exists in many Insects. When such a
  union occurs, it is usually most complete on the dorsal surface, and the first ventral plate may
  almost totally disappear: such an alteration may involve a certain amount of change in the
  sclerites of the next segment, so that the morphological determination of the parts at the back of
  the thorax and front of the abdomen is by no means a simple matter. A highly modified hind-body
  exists in the higher ants, Myrmicidae. In Fig. 60 we contrast the simple abdomen of <i>Japyx</i>
  with the highly modified state of the same part in an ant.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      The segments are numbered from before backwards.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Unlike the head and thorax, the abdomen is so loosely knitted together that it can undergo much
  expansion and contraction. <span class="pagenum" id="page110"><span
  class="smaller">{110}</span></span>This is facilitated by an imbricated arrangement of the plates,
  and by their being connected by means of membranes admitting of much movement (Fig. 47, <i>m</i>,
  <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page88">88</a></span>). In order to understand the structure of the
  abdomen it should be studied in its most distended state; it is then seen that there is a dorsal
  and a ventral hard plate to each ring, and there is also usually a stigma; there may be foldings
  or plications near the line of junction of the dorsal and ventral plates, but these margins are
  not really distinct pieces. The pleura, in fact, remain membranous in the abdominal region,
  contrasting strongly with the condition of these parts in the thorax. The proportions of the
  plates vary greatly; sometimes the ventral are very large in proportion to the dorsal, as is
  usually the case in Coleoptera, while in the Orthoptera the reverse condition prevails.</p>

  <p>Cerci or other appendages frequently exist at the extremity of the abdomen (Fig. 47, <i>n</i>,
  <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page88">88</a></span>); the former are sometimes like antennae,
  while in other cases they may be short compressed processes consisting of very few joints. The
  females of many Insects possess saws or piercing instruments concealed within the apical part of
  the abdomen; in other cases an elongate exserted organ, called ovipositor, used for placing the
  eggs in suitable positions, is present. Such organs consist, it is thought, either of modified
  appendages, called gonapophyses, or of dorsal, ventral, or pleural plates. The males frequently
  bear within the extremity of the body a more or less complicated apparatus called the genital
  armour. The term gonapophysis is at present a vague one, including stings, some ovipositors,
  portions of male copulatory apparatus, or other structures, of which the origin is more or less
  obscure.</p>

  <p>The caterpillar, or larva, of the Lepidoptera and some other Insects, bears a greater number of
  legs than the three pairs we have mentioned as being the normal number in Insects, but the
  posterior feet are in this case very different from the anterior, and are called false legs or
  prolegs. These prolegs, which are placed on the hind body, bear a series of hooks in Lepidopterous
  larvae, but the analogous structures of Sawfly larvae are destitute of such hooks.</p>

  <p>Placed along the sides of the body, usually quite visible in the larva, but more or less
  concealed in the perfect Insect, are little apertures for the admittance of air to the respiratory
  <span class="pagenum" id="page111"><span class="smaller">{111}</span></span>system. They are
  called spiracles or stigmata. There is extreme variety in their structure and size; the largest
  and most remarkable are found on the prothorax of Coleoptera, especially in the groups Copridae
  and Cerambycidae.</p>

  <p>The exact position of the stigmata varies greatly, as does also their number. In the Order
  Aptera there may be none, while the maximum number of eleven pairs is said by Grassi<a id="NtA_26"
  href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> to be attained in <i>Japyx solifugus</i>: in no other Insect
  have more than ten pairs been recorded, and this number is comparatively rare. Both position and
  number frequently differ in the early and later stages of the same Insect. The structure of the
  stigmata is quite as inconstant as the other points we have mentioned are.</p>

  <p>The admission of air to the tracheal system and its confinement there, as well as the exclusion
  of foreign bodies, have to be provided for. The control of the air within the system is, according
  to Landois<a id="NtA_27" href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> and Krancher,<a id="NtA_28"
  href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> usually accomplished by means of an occluding apparatus placed
  on the tracheal trunk a little inside of the stigma, and in such case this latter orifice serves
  chiefly as a means for preventing the intrusion of foreign bodies. The occluding apparatus
  consists of muscular and mechanical parts, which differ much in their details in different
  Insects. Lowne supposes that the air is maintained in the tracheal system in a compressed
  condition, and if this be so, this apparatus must be of great importance in the Insect economy.
  Miall and Denny<a id="NtA_29" href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> state that in the anterior
  stigmata of the cockroach the valves act as the occluding agents, muscles being attached directly
  to the inner face of the valves, and in some other Insects the spiracular valves appear to act
  partially by muscular agency, but there are many stigmata having valves destitute of muscles.
  According to Lowne<a id="NtA_30" href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> there exist valves in the
  blowfly at the entrance to the trachea proper, and he gives the following as the arrangement of
  parts for the admission of air:&mdash;there is a spiracle <span class="pagenum" id="page112"><span
  class="smaller">{112}</span></span>leading into a chamber, the atrium, which is limited inwardly
  by the occluding apparatus; and beyond this there is a second chamber, the vestibule, separated
  from the tracheae proper by a valvular arrangement. He considers that the vestibule acts as a pump
  to force the air into the tracheae.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Terms relating to position are unfortunately used by writers on entomology in
  various, even in opposite senses. Great confusion exists as to the application of such words as
  base, apex, transverse, longitudinal. We can best explain the way in which the relative positions
  and directions of parts should be described by reference to Figure 62. The spot 3 represents an
  imaginary centre, situated between the thorax and abdomen, to which all the parts of the body are
  supposed to be related. The Insect should always be described as if it were in the position shown
  in the Figure, and the terms used should not vary as the position is changed. The creature is
  placed with ventral surface beneath, and with the appendages extended, like the Insect itself, in
  a horizontal plane. In the Figure the legs are, for clearness, made to radiate, but in the proper
  position the anterior pair should be approximate in front, and the middle and hind pairs directed
  backwards under the body. The legs are not to be treated as if they were hanging from the body,
  though that is the position they frequently actually assume. The right and left sides, and the
  upper and lower faces (these latter are frequently also spoken of as sides), are still to retain
  the same nomenclature even when the position of the specimen is reversed. The base of an organ is
  that margin that is nearest to the ideal centre, the apex that which is most distant. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page113"><span class="smaller">{113}</span></span>Thus in Fig. 62, where 1
  indicates the front tibia, the apex (A) is broader than the base (B); in the antennae the apex is
  the front part, while in the cerci the apex is the posterior part; in the last abdominal segment
  (2) the base (B) is in front of the apex (A). The terms longitudinal and transverse should always
  be used with reference to the two chief axes of the body-surface; longitudinal referring to the
  axis extending from before backwards, and transverse to that going across, <i>i.e.</i> from side
  to side.</p>

  <p>Many of the anatomical structures have positions in the body that are fairly constant
  throughout the class. Parts of the respiratory and muscular systems and the fat-body occur in most
  of the districts of the body. The heart is placed just below the dorsal surface; the alimentary
  canal extends along the middle from the head to the end of the body. The chief parts of the
  nervous system are below the alimentary canal, except that the brain is placed above the beginning
  of the canal in the head. The reproductive system extends in the abdomen obliquely from above
  downwards, commencing anteriorly at the upper part and terminating posteriorly at the lower part
  of the body cavity.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In Fig. 63 we show the arrangement of some of the chief organs of the body, with
  the exception of the muscular and respiratory systems, and the fat-body. It is scarcely necessary
  to point out that the figure is merely diagrammatic, and does not show the shapes and sizes of the
  organs as they will be found in any one Insect.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Muscles.</b></p>

  <p>The muscular system of Insects is very extensive, Lyonnet<a id="NtA_31"
  href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> having found, it is said, nearly 4000 muscles in the caterpillar
  of the goat-moth; a large part of this number are segmental repetitions, nevertheless the muscular
  system is really complex, as may be seen by referring to the study of the flight of dragon-flies
  by von Lendenfeld.<a id="NtA_32" href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The minute structure of the muscles does not differ essentially from what obtains in Vertebrate
  animals. The muscles are aggregations of minute fibrils which are transversely striated, though in
  variable degree. Those in the thorax are yellow or pale brown, but in other parts the colour is
  more nearly white. The muscles of flight are described as being penetrated by numerous tracheae,
  while those found elsewhere are merely surrounded by these aerating tubules.</p>

  <p>The force brought into play by the contractions of Insect muscles is very great, and has been
  repeatedly stated to be much superior to that of Vertebrate animals; very little reliance can,
  however, be <span class="pagenum" id="page116"><span class="smaller">{116}</span></span>placed on
  the assumptions and calculations that are supposed to prove this, and it is not supported by
  Camerano's recent researches.<a id="NtA_33" href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Some of the tendons to which the muscles are attached are very elaborate structures, and are as
  hard as the chitinous skeleton, so as to be like small bones in their nature. A very elaborate
  tendon of this kind is connected with the prothoracic trochantin in Coleoptera, and may be readily
  examined in <i>Hydrophilus</i>. It has been suggested that the entothorax is tendinous in its
  origin, but other morphologists treat it, with more reason, as an elaborate fold inwards of the
  integument.</p>

      Brandt.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="ac"><b>Nervous System.</b></p>

  <p>Insects are provided with a very complex nervous system, which may be treated as consisting of
  three divisions:&mdash;(1) The cephalic system; (2) the ventral, or ganglionic chain; (3) an
  accessory sympathetic system, or systems. All these divisions are intimately connected. We will
  consider first the most extensive, viz. the ventral chain. This consists of a series of small
  masses of nervous matter called ganglia which extend in the longitudinal direction of the body
  along the median line of the lower aspect, and are connected by longitudinal commissures, each
  ganglion being joined to that following it by two threads of nervous matter. Each of the ganglia
  of the ventral chain really consists of two ganglia placed side by side and connected by
  commissures as well as cellular matter. In larvae some of the ganglia may be contiguous, so that
  the commissures do not exist. From the ganglia motor nerves proceed to the various parts of the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page117"><span class="smaller">{117}</span></span>body for the purpose
  of stimulating and co-ordinating the contractions of the muscles. The number of the ganglia in the
  ventral chain differs greatly in different Insects, and even in the different stages of
  metamorphosis of the same species, but never exceeds thirteen. As this number is that of the
  segments of the body, it has been considered that each segment had primitively a single ganglion.
  Thirteen ganglia for the ventral chain can, however, be only demonstrated in the embryonic state;
  in the later stages of life eleven appears to be the largest number that can be distinguished, and
  so many as this are found but rarely, and then chiefly in the larval stage. The diminution in
  number takes place by the amalgamation or coalescence of some of the ganglia, and hence those
  Insects in which the ganglia are few are said to have a highly concentrated nervous system. The
  modes in which these ganglia combine are very various; the most usual is perhaps that of the
  combination of the three terminal ganglia into one body. As a rule it may be said that
  concentration is the concomitant of a more forward position of the ganglia. As a result of this it
  is found that in some cases, as in Lamellicorn beetles, there are no ganglia situate in the
  abdomen. In the perfect state of the higher Diptera, the thoracic and abdominal ganglia are so
  completely concentrated in the thorax as to form a sort of thoracic brain. In Fig. 64 we represent
  a very diffuse and a very concentrated ganglionic chain; A being that of the larva of
  <i>Chironomus</i>, B that of the imago of <i>Hippobosca</i>. In both these sketches the cephalic
  ganglia as well as those of the ventral chain are shown.</p>

  <p>Turning next to the cephalic masses, we find these in the perfect Insect to be nearly always
  two in number: a very large and complex one placed above the oesophagus, and therefore called the
  supra-oesophageal ganglion; and a smaller one, the sub- or infra-oesophageal, placed below the
  oesophagus. The latter ganglion is in many Insects so closely approximated to the
  supra-oesophageal ganglion that it appears to be a part thereof, and is sometimes spoken of as the
  lower brain. In other Insects these two ganglia are more remote, and the infra-oesophageal one
  then appears part of the ventral chain. In the embryo it is said that the mode of development of
  the supra-oesophageal ganglion lends support to the idea that it may be the equivalent of three
  ganglia; there being at one <span class="pagenum" id="page118"><span
  class="smaller">{118}</span></span>time three lobes, which afterwards coalesce, on each side of
  the mouth. This is in accordance with the view formulated by Viallanes<a id="NtA_34"
  href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> to the effect that this great nerve-centre, or brain, as it is
  frequently called, consists essentially of three parts, viz. a Proto-, a Deuto-, and a
  Trito-cerebron. It is, however, only proper to say that though the brain and the ventral chain of
  ganglia may appear to be one system, and in the early embryonic condition to be actually
  continuous, these points cannot be considered to be fully established. Dr. L. Will has informed
  us<a id="NtA_35" href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> that in Aphididae the brain has a separate
  origin, and is only subsequently united with the ganglionic chain. Some authorities say that in
  the early condition the sub-oesophageal ganglion is formed from two, and the supra-oesophageal
  from the same number of ganglia; the division in that case being 2 and 2, not 3 and 1, as
  Viallanes' views would suggest. The inquiries that are necessary to establish such points involve
  very complex and delicate investigations, so that it is not a matter of surprise that it cannot
  yet be said whether each of these views may be in certain cases correct. The supra- and
  sub-oesophageal ganglia are always intimately connected by a commissure on each side of the
  oesophagus; when very closely approximated they look like one mass through which passes the
  oesophagus (Fig. 66, A). The large supra-oesophageal ganglion supplies the great nerves of the
  cephalic sense-organs, while the smaller sub-oesophageal centre gives off the nerves to the parts
  of the mouth. From the lower and anterior part of the supra-oesophageal ganglion a nervous
  filament extends as a ring round the anterior part of the oesophagus, and supplies a nerve to the
  upper lip.<a id="NtA_36" href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> This structure is not very well known,
  and has been chiefly studied by Li&eacute;nard,<a id="NtA_37" href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> who
  considers that it will prove to be present in all Insects.</p>

  <p>Whether the two cephalic ganglia be considered as really part of a single great ganglionic
  chain, or the reverse, they are at any rate always intimately connected with the ventral ganglia.
  We have already stated that the two cephalic masses are themselves closely approximated in many
  Insects, and may add that in some Hemiptera the first thoracic ganglion of the ventral chain is
  amalgamated into one body with the sub-oesophageal ganglion, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page119"><span class="smaller">{119}</span></span>and further that there are a few Insects in
  which this latter centre is wanting. If the cephalic ganglia and ventral chain be looked on as
  part of one system, this may be considered as composed originally of seventeen ganglia, which
  number has been demonstrated in some embryos.</p>

  <p>The anatomy of the supra-oesophageal ganglion is very complex; it has been recently
  investigated by Viallanes<a id="NtA_38" href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> in the wasp
  (<i>Vespa</i>) and in a grasshopper (<i>Caloptenus italicus</i>). The development and complication
  of its inner structure and of some of its outer parts appear to be proportional with the state of
  advancement of the instinct or intelligence of the Insect, and Viallanes found the brain of the
  grasshopper to be of a more simple nature than that of the wasp.</p>

      rufa</i>. (After Leydig, highly magnified.) Explanation in text.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Brandt, to whom is due a large part of our knowledge of the anatomy of the nervous system in
  Insects, says that the supra-oesophageal ganglion varies greatly in size in various Insects, its
  mass being to a great extent proportional with the development of the compound eyes; hence the
  absolute size is not a criterion for the amount of intelligence, and we must rather look to the
  complication of the structure and to the development of certain parts for an index of this nature.
  The drone in the honey-bee has, correlatively with the superior development of its eyes, a larger
  brain than the worker, but the size of the hemispheres, and the development of the gyri cerebrales
  is superior in the latter. In other words, the mass of <span class="pagenum" id="page120"><span
  class="smaller">{120}</span></span>those great lobes of the brain that are directly connected with
  the faceted eyes must not be taken into account in a consideration of the relation of the size and
  development of the brain to the intelligence of the individual. The weight of the brain in Insects
  is said by Lowne to vary from <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">150</span> to
  <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">2500</span> of the weight of the body.</p>

  <p>Besides the brain and the great chain of ganglia there exists an accessory system, or systems,
  sometimes called the sympathetic, vagus, or visceral system. Although complex, these parts are
  delicate and difficult of dissection, and are consequently not so well known as is the ganglionic
  chain. There is a connecting or median nerve cord, communicating with the longitudinal commissures
  of each segment, and itself dilating into ganglia at intervals; this is sometimes called the
  unpaired system. There is another group of nerves having paired ganglia, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page121"><span class="smaller">{121}</span></span>starting from a small ganglion in the
  forehead, then connecting with the brain, and afterwards extending along the oesophagus to the
  crop and proventriculus (Fig. 66). This is usually called the stomatogastric system. The
  oesophageal ring we have already spoken of.</p>

  <p>By means of these accessory nervous systems all the organs of the body are brought into more or
  less direct relation with the brain and the ganglionic chain.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Our knowledge of these subsidiary nervous systems is by no means extensive, and
  their nomenclature is very unsettled; little is actually known as to their functions.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Organs of Sense.</b></p>

  <p>Insects have most delicate powers of perception, indeed they are perhaps superior in this
  respect to the other classes of animals. Their senses, though probably on the whole analogous to
  those of the Vertebrata, are certainly far from corresponding therewith, and their sense organs
  seem to be even more different from those of what we call the higher animals than the functions
  themselves are. We have already briefly sketched the structure of the optical organs, which are
  invariably situate on the head. This is not the case with the ears, which certainly exist in one
  Order,&mdash;the Orthoptera,&mdash;and are placed either on the front legs below the knee, or at
  the base of the abdomen. Notwithstanding their strange situation, the structures alluded to are
  undoubtedly auditory, and somewhat approximate in nature to the ear of Vertebrates, being placed
  in proximity to the inner face of a tense membrane; we shall refer to them when considering the
  Orthoptera. Sir John Lubbock considers&mdash;no doubt with reason&mdash;that some ants have
  auditory organs in the tibia. Many Insects possess rod-like or bristle-like structures in various
  parts of the body, called chordotonal organs; they are considered by Graber<a id="NtA_39"
  href="#Nt_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> and others to have auditory functions, though they are not to be
  compared with the definite ears of the Orthoptera.</p>

  <p>The other senses and sense organs of Insects are even less known, and have given rise to much
  perplexity; for though many structures have been detected that may with more or less probability
  be looked on as sense organs, it is difficult to assign a <span class="pagenum" id="page122"><span
  class="smaller">{122}</span></span>particular function to any of them, except it be to the sensory
  hairs. These are seated on various parts of the body. The chitinous covering, being a dead, hard
  substance, has no nerves distributed in it, but it is pierced with orifices, and in some of these
  there is implanted a hair which at its base is in connexion with a nerve; such a structure may
  possibly be sensitive not only to contact with solid bodies, but even to various kinds of
  vibration. We give a figure (Fig. 67) of some of these hairs on the caudal appendage of a cricket,
  after Vom Rath. The small hairs on the outer surface of the chitin in this figure have no sensory
  function, but each of the others probably has; and these latter, being each accompanied by a
  different structure, must, though so closely approximated, be supposed to have a different
  function; but in what way those that have no direct connexion with a nerve may act it is difficult
  to guess.</p>

  <p>The antennae of Insects are the seats of a great variety of sense organs, many of which are
  modifications of the hair, pit and nerve structure we have described above, but others cannot be
  brought within this category.  Amongst these we may mention the pits covered with membrane
  (figured by various writers), perforations of the chitin without any hair, and membranous bodies
  either concealed in cavities or partially protruding therefrom.</p>

  <p>Various parts of the mouth are also the seats of sense organs of different kinds, some of them

  represent in Fig. 68 may be located in the interior of the apical portion of the palp.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The functions of the various structures that have been detected are, as already
  remarked, very difficult to discover. Vom Rath thinks the cones he describes on the antennae and
  palpi are organs of smell, while he assigns to those on the maxillae, lower lip, epipharynx, and
  hypopharynx the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of taste organs, but admits he cannot draw any absolute line of
  distinction between the two forms. The opinions of Kraepelin, Hauser, and Will, as well as those
  of various earlier writers, are considered in Sir John Lubbock's book on this subject.<a
  id="NtA_41" href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Alimentary and Nutritive System.</b></p>

  <p>The alimentary canal occupies the median longitudinal axis of the body, being situated below
  the dorsal vessel, and above the ventral nervous chain; it extends from the mouth to the opposite
  extremity of the body. It varies greatly in the different kinds of Insects, but in all its forms
  it is recognised as consisting essentially of three divisions: anterior, middle, and posterior.
  The first and last of these divisions are considered to be of quite different morphological nature
  from the middle part, or true stomach, and to be, as it were, invaginations of the extremities of
  a closed bag; it is ascertained that in the embryo these invaginations have really blind
  extremities (see Fig. 82, <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page151">151</a></span>), and only
  subsequently become connected with the middle part of the canal. There are even some larvae of
  Insects in which the posterior portion of the canal is not opened till near the close of the
  larval life; this is the case with many Hymenoptera, and it is probable, though not as frequently
  stated certain, that the occlusion marks the point of junction of the proctodaeum with the
  stomach. The anterior and posterior parts of the canal are formed by the ectoderm of the embryo,
  and in embryological and morphological language are called respectively the stomodaeum and
  proctodaeum; the true stomach is formed from the endoderm, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page124"><span class="smaller">{124}</span></span>and the muscular layer of the whole canal
  from the mesoderm.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      <i>g</i>, small intestine; <i>h</i>, large intestine; <i>i</i>, Malpighian tubes; <i>k</i>,
      termination of body.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The alimentary canal is more complex anatomically than it is morphologically, and various parts
  are distinguished, viz. the canal and its appendicula; the former consisting of oesophagus, crop,
  gizzard, true stomach, and an intestine divided into two or more parts. It should be remarked that
  though it is probable that the morphological distinctions correspond to a great extent with the
  anatomical lines of demarcation, yet this has not been sufficiently ascertained: the origin of the
  proctodaeum in <i>Musca</i> is indeed a point of special difficulty, and one on which there is
  considerable diversity of opinion. In some Hemiptera the division of the canal into three parts is
  very obscure, so that it would be more correct, as Dufour says, to define it as consisting in
  these Insects of two main divisions&mdash;one anterior to, the other posterior to, the insertion
  of the Malpighian tubes.</p>

  <p>It should be borne in mind that the alimentary canal is very different in different Insects, so
  that the brief general description we must confine ourselves to will not be found to apply
  satisfactorily to any one Insect. The oesophagus is the part behind the mouth, and is usually
  narrow, as it has to pass through the most important nervous centres; extremely variable in
  length, it dilates behind to form the crop. It may, too, have a dilatation immediately behind the
  mouth, and in such case a pharynx is considered to exist. The crop is broader than the oesophagus,
  and must be looked on as a mere dilatation of the latter, as no line of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page125"><span class="smaller">{125}</span></span>demarcation can be pointed out between the
  two, and the crop may be totally absent.</p>

  <p>In some of the sucking Insects there is a lateral diverticulum, having a stalk of greater or
  less length, called the sucking-stomach; it is by no means certain that the function this name
  implies is correctly assigned to the organ.</p>

  <p>The gizzard or proventriculus (French, <i>g&eacute;sier</i>; German, <i>Kaumagen</i>) is a small body
  interposed in some Insects between the true stomach and the crop or oesophagus. It is frequently
  remarkable for the development of its chitinous lining into strong toothed or ridged processes
  that look as if they were well adapted for the comminution of food. The function of the
  proventriculus in some Insects is obscure; its structure is used by systematists in the
  classification of ants. The extremity of the proventriculus not infrequently projects into the
  cavity of the stomach.</p>

  <p>The true stomach, or chylific ventricle (<i>Magen</i> or <i>Mitteldarm</i> of the Germans), is
  present in all the post-embryonic stages of the Insect's life, existing even in the imagines of
  those who live only for a few hours, and do not use the stomach for any alimentary purpose. It is
  so variable in shape and capacity that no general description of it can be given. Sometimes it is
  very elongate, so that it is coiled and like an intestine in shape; it very frequently bears
  diverticula or pouches, which are placed on the anterior part, and vary greatly in size, sometimes
  they are only two in number, while in other cases they are so numerous that a portion of the
  outside of the stomach looks as if it were covered with villi. A division of the stomach into two
  parts is in some cases very marked, and the posterior portion may, in certain cases, be mistaken
  for the intestine; but the position of the Malpighian tubes serves as a mark for the distinction
  of the two structures, the tubes being inserted just at the junction of the stomach with the
  intestine.</p>

  <p>The intestine is very variable in length: the anterior part is the smaller, and is frequently
  spoken of as the colon; at the extremity of the body the gut becomes much larger, so as to form a
  rectum. There is occasionally a diverticulum or "caecum" connected with the rectum, and in some
  Insects stink-glands. In some Hemiptera there is no small intestine, the Malpighian tubes being
  inserted at the junction of the stomach with the <span class="pagenum" id="page126"><span
  class="smaller">{126}</span></span>rectum. The total length of the alimentary canal is extremely
  variable; it is necessarily at least as long as the distance between the mouth and anal orifice,
  but sometimes it is five or six times as long as this, and some of its parts then form coils in
  the abdominal cavity.</p>

  <p>The alimentary canal has two coats of muscles: a longitudinal and a transverse or annular. Both
  coexist in most of its parts. Internal to these coats there exists in the anterior and posterior
  parts of the canal a chitinous layer, which in the stomach is replaced by a remarkable epithelium,
  the cells of which are renewed, new ones growing while the old are still in activity. We figure a
  portion of this structure after Miall and Denny, and may remark that Oudemans<a id="NtA_42"
  href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> has verified the correctness of their representation. The layers

  </div>

  <p>In addition to the various diverticula we have mentioned, there are two important sets of
  organs connected with the alimentary canal, viz. the salivary glands and the Malpighian tubes.</p>

  <p>The salivary glands are present in many Insects, but are absent in others. They are situate in
  the anterior portion of the body, and are very variable in their development, being sometimes very
  extensive, in other cases inconspicuous. They consist either of simple tubes lined with cells, or
  of branched tubes, or of tubes dilated laterally into little acini or groups of bags, the
  arrangement then somewhat resembling that of a bunch of grapes. There are sometimes large sacs or
  reservoirs connected with the efferent tubes proceeding from the secreting portions of the glands.
  The salivary glands ultimately discharge into the mouth, so that the fluid secreted by them has to
  be <span class="pagenum" id="page127"><span class="smaller">{127}</span></span>swallowed in the
  same manner as the food, not improbably along with it. The silk so copiously produced by some
  larvae comes from very long tubes similar in form and situation to the simple tubes of the
  salivary glands.</p>

  <p>The Malpighian tubules are present in most Insects, though they are considered on good
  authority to be absent in many Collembola and in some Thysanura. They are placed near the
  posterior part of the body, usually opening into the alimentary canal just at the junction of the
  stomach and the intestine, at a spot called the pylorus. They vary excessively in length and in
  number,<a id="NtA_43" href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> being sometimes only two, while in other
  cases there may be a hundred or even more of them. In some cases they are budded off from the
  hind-gut of the embryo when this is still very small; in other cases they appear later; frequently
  their number is greater in the adult than it is in the young. In <i>Gryllotalpa</i> there is one
  tube or duct with a considerable number of finer tubes at the end of it. There is no muscular
  layer in the Malpighian tubes, they being lined with cells which leave a free canal in the centre.
  The tubes are now thought, on considerable evidence, to be organs for the excretion of uric acid
  or urates, but it is not known how they are emptied. Marchal has stated<a id="NtA_44"
  href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> that he has seen the Malpighian tubes, on extraction from the
  body, undergo worm-like movements; he suggests that their contents may be expelled by similar
  movements when they are in the body.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The functions of the different portions of the alimentary canal, and the extent to
  which the ingested food is acted on by their mechanical structures or their products is very
  obscure, and different opinions prevail on important points. It would appear that the saliva
  exercises a preparatory action on the food, and that the absorption of the nutritive matter into
  the body cavity takes place chiefly from the true stomach, while the Malpighian tubes perform an
  excretory function. Beyond these elementary, though but vaguely ascertained facts, little is
  known, though Plateau's<a id="NtA_45" href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> and Jousset's researches
  on the digestion of Insects throw some light on the subject.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page128"><span class="smaller">{128}</span></span></div>

  <p class="ac"><b>Respiratory Organs.</b></p>

  <p>The respiration of Insects is carried on by means of a system of vessels for the conveyance of
  air to all parts of the body; this system is most remarkably developed and elaborate, and
  contrasts strongly with the mechanism for the circulation of the blood, which is as much reduced
  as the air system is highly developed, as well as with the arrangement that exists in the
  Vertebrates. There are in Insects no lungs, but air is carried to every part of the body directly
  by means of tracheae. These tracheae connect with the spiracles&mdash;the orifices at the sides of
  the body we have already mentioned when describing the external structures&mdash;and the air thus
  finds its way into the most remote recesses of the Insect's body. The tracheae are all intimately
  connected. Large tubes connect the spiracles longitudinally, others pass from side to side of the
  body, and a set of tracheae for the lower part of the body is connected with another set on the
  upper surface by means of several descending tubes. From these main channels smaller branches
  extend in all directions, forking and giving off twigs, so that all the organs inside the body can
  be supplied with air in the most liberal manner. On opening a freshly deceased Insect the
  abundance of the tracheae is one of the peculiarities that most attracts the attention; and as
  these tubes have a peculiar white glistening appearance, they are recognised without difficulty.
  In Insects of active flight, possibly in some that are more passive, though never in larvae, there
  are air-sacs, of more than one kind, connected with the tracheae, and these are sufficiently
  capacious to have a considerable effect in diminishing the specific gravity of the Insect. The
  most usual situation for these sacs is the basal portion of the abdominal cavity, on the great
  lateral tracheal conduits. In speaking of the external structure we have remarked that the
  stigmata, or spiracles, by which the air is admitted are very various in their size and in the
  manner in which they open and close. Some spiracles have no power of opening; while others are
  provided with a muscular and valvular apparatus for the purpose of opening and closing
  effectually.</p>

  <p>The structure of the tracheae is remarkable: they are elastic and consist of an outer cellular,
  and an inner chitinous layer; this latter is strengthened by a peculiar spiral fibre, which gives
  <span class="pagenum" id="page129"><span class="smaller">{129}</span></span>to the tubes, when
  examined with the microscope, a transversely, closely striated appearance. Packard considers<a
  id="NtA_46" href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> that in some tracheae this fibre is not really
  spiral, but consists of a large number of closely placed rings. Such a condition has not, however,
  been recorded by any other observer. The spiral fibre is absent in the fine capillary twigs of the
  tracheal system, as well as from the expanded sacs. The mode of termination of the capillary
  branches is not clear. Some have supposed that the finest twigs anastomose with others; on the
  other hand it has been said that they terminate by penetrating cells, or that they simply come to
  an end with either open or closed extremities. Wistinghausen<a id="NtA_47"
  href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> states that in the silk-glands the tracheal twigs anastomose,
  and he is of opinion that the fine terminal portions contain fluid. However this may be, it is
  certain that all the organs are abundantly supplied with a capillary tracheal network, or arboreal
  ramification, and that in some cases the tubes enter the substance of tissues. Near their
  terminations they are said to be <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">30</span> to
  <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">60</span> millimetre in diameter.</p>

  <p>We must repeat that such a system as we have just sketched forms a striking contrast to the
  imperfect blood-vascular system, and that Insects differ profoundly in these respects from
  Vertebrate animals. In the latter the blood-vessels penetrate to all <span class="pagenum"
  id="page130"><span class="smaller">{130}</span></span>the tissues and form capillaries, while the
  aerating apparatus is confined to one part of the body; in Insects the blood-circulating system is
  very limited, and air is carried directly by complex vessels to all parts; thus the tracheal
  system is universally recognised as one of the most remarkable of the characters of Insects. Many
  Insects have a very active respiratory system, as is shown by the rapidity with which they are
  affected by agents like chloroform; but the exact manner in which the breathing is carried on is
  unknown. In living Insects rapid movements of contraction and expansion of parts of the body,
  chiefly the abdomen, may be observed, and these body contractions are sometimes accompanied by
  opening and shutting the spiracular orifices: it has been inferred that these phenomena are
  respiratory. Although such movements are not always present, it is possible that when they occur
  they may force the air onwards to the tissues, though this is by no means certain. It is clear
  that the tracheal system is the usual means of supplying the organisation with oxygen, but it
  appears to be improbable that it can also act as the agent for removing the carbonaceous products
  of tissue-changes. It has been thought possible that carbonic acid might reach the spiracles from
  the remote capillaries by a process of diffusion,<a id="NtA_48" href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a>
  but it should be recollected that as some Insects have no tracheal system, there must exist some
  other mode of eliminating carbonic acid, and it is possible that this mode may continue to operate
  as an important agent of purification, even when the tracheal system is, as a bearer of air to the
  tissues, highly developed. Eisig<a id="NtA_49" href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> has suggested
  that the formation of chitin is an act of excretion; if so this is capable of relieving the system
  of carbonic acid to some extent. Others have maintained that transpiration takes place through the
  delicate portions of the integument. Lubbock<a id="NtA_50" href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> has
  shown that Melolontha larvae breathe "partly by means of their skin." The mode in which the carbon
  of tissue-change, and the nitrogen of inspiration are removed, is still obscure; but it appears
  probable that the views expressed by R&eacute;aumur, Lyonnet, and Lowne<a id="NtA_51"
  href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> as to inspiration and expiration may prove to be nearer the
  truth than those which are more widely current. In <span class="pagenum" id="page131"><span
  class="smaller">{131}</span></span>connexion with this it should be recollected that the outer
  integument consists of chitin, and is cast and renewed several times during the life of the
  individual. Now as chitin consists largely of carbon and nitrogen, it is evident that the moulting
  must itself serve as a carbonaceous and nitrogenous excretion. If, as is suggested by Bataillon's
  researches,<a id="NtA_52" href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> the condition accompanying
  metamorphosis be that of asphyxia, it is probable that the secretion of the new coat of chitin may
  figure as an act of excretion of considerable importance. If there be any truth in this suggestion
  it may prove the means of enabling us to comprehend some points in the development of Insects that
  have hitherto proved very perplexing.</p>

  <p>Peyrou has shown<a id="NtA_53" href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> that the atmosphere extracted
  from the bodies of Insects (<i>Melolontha</i>) is much less rich in oxygen than the surrounding
  atmosphere is, and at ordinary temperatures always contains a much larger proportion of carbonic
  acid: he finds, too, that as in the leaves with which he makes a comparison, the proportion of
  oxygen augments as the protoplasmic activity diminishes. Were such an observation carried out so
  as to distinguish between the air in the tracheal system and the gas in other parts of the body
  the result would be still more interesting.</p>

  <p>We know very little as to the animal heat produced by insects, but it is clear from various
  observations<a id="NtA_54" href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> that the amount evolved in repose is
  very small. In different conditions of activity the temperature of the insect may rise to be
  several degrees above that of the surrounding medium, but there seems to be at present no
  information as to the physiological mode of its production, and as to the channel by which the
  products&mdash;whether carbonic acid or other matters&mdash;may be disposed of.</p>

  <p>In the order Aptera (Thysanura and Collembola) the tracheal system is highly peculiar. In some
  Collembola it apparently does not exist, and in this case we may presume with greater certainty
  that transpiration of gases occurs through the integument: in other members of this Order tracheae
  are present in a more or less imperfect state of development, but the tracheae of different
  segments do not communicate with one another, <span class="pagenum" id="page132"><span
  class="smaller">{132}</span></span>thus forming a remarkable contrast to the amalgamated tracheal
  system of the other Orders of Insects, where, even when the tracheal system is much reduced in
  extent (as in Coccidae), it is nevertheless completely unified. <i>Gryllotalpa</i> is, however,
  said by Dohrn<a id="NtA_55" href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> to be exceptional in this respect;
  the tracheae connected with each spiracle remaining unconnected.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Water Insects have usually peculiarities in their respiratory systems, though these
  are not so great as might <i>&agrave; priori</i> have been anticipated. Some breathe by coming to the
  surface and taking in a supply of air in various manners, but some apparently obtain from the
  water itself the air necessary for their physiological processes. Aquatic Insects are frequently
  provided with gills, which may be either wing-like expansions of the integument containing some
  tracheae (Ephemeridae larvae), or bunches of tubes, or single tubes (Trichoptera larvae). Such
  Insects may either possess stigmata in addition to the gills, or be destitute of them. In other
  cases air is obtained by taking water into the posterior part of the alimentary canal (many
  dragon-flies), which part is then provided with special tracheae. Some water-larvae appear to
  possess neither stigmata nor gills (certain Perlidae and Diptera), and it is supposed that these
  obtain air through the integument; in such Insects tracheal twigs may frequently be seen on the
  interior of the skin. In the imago state it is the rule that Water Insects breathe by means of
  stigmata, and that they carry about with them a supply of air sufficient for a longer or shorter
  period. A great many Insects that live in water in their earlier stages and breathe there by
  peculiar means, in their perfect imago state live in the air and breathe in the usual manner.
  There are, in both terrestrial and aquatic Insects, a few cases of exsertile sacs without
  tracheae, but filled with blood (<i>Pelobius</i> larva, <i>Machilis</i>, etc.); and such organs
  are supposed to be of a respiratory nature, though there does not appear to be any positive
  evidence to that effect.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Blood and Blood-Circulation.</b></p>

  <p>Owing to the great complexity of the tracheal system, and to its general diffusion in the body,
  the blood and its circulation are very different in Insects from what they are in Vertebrates, so
  <span class="pagenum" id="page133"><span class="smaller">{133}</span></span>that it is scarcely
  conducive to the progress of physiological knowledge to call two fluids with such different
  functions by one name. The blood of Insects varies according to the species, and in all
  probability even in conformity with the stage of the life of the individual. Its primary office is
  that of feeding the tissues it bathes, and it cannot be considered as having any aerating
  function. It is frequently crowded with fatty substances. Graber says: "The richness of Insect
  blood in unsaponified or unelaborated fat shows in the plainest manner that it is more properly a
  mixture of blood and chyle; or indeed we might say with greater accuracy, leaving out of
  consideration certain matters to be eliminated from it, that it is a refined or distilled chyle."
  Connected in the most intimate manner with the blood there is a large quantity of material called
  vaguely the fat-body; the blood and its adjuncts of this kind being called by Wielowiejski<a
  id="NtA_56" href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> the blood-tissue. We shall return to the
  consideration of this tissue after sketching the apparatus for distributing the refined chyle, or
  blood as we must, using the ordinary term, call it.</p>

  <p>There is in Insects no complete system of blood-vessels, though there is a pulsating vessel to
  ensure distribution of the nutritive fluid. This dorsal vessel, or heart as it is frequently
  called, may be distinguished and its pulsations watched, in transparent Insects when alive. It is
  situate at the upper part of the body, extending from the posterior extremity, or near it, to the
  head or thorax, and is an elongate tube, consisting as it were of a number of united chambers; it
  is closed behind, except in some larvae, but is open in front, and has several orifices at the
  sides; these orifices, or ostia, are frequently absent from the front part of the tube, which
  portion is also narrower, being called the aorta&mdash;by no means a suitable term. Near the
  lateral orifices there are delicate folds, which act to some extent as valves, facilitating, in
  conjunction with the mode of contraction of the vessel, a forward movement of the blood. The
  composition of the tube, or series of chambers, is that of a muscular layer, with internal and
  external membranous coverings, the intima and adventitia. Olga Poletajewa states<a id="NtA_57"
  href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> that in <i>Bombus</i> the dorsal vessel consists of five
  chambers placed in longitudinal succession, and not very intimately connected, and that there is
  but little <span class="pagenum" id="page134"><span class="smaller">{134}</span></span>valvular
  structure.  In <i>Cimbex</i> she finds a similar arrangement, but there are ten chambers, and no
  aorta.</p>

  <p>The dorsal vessel is connected with the roof of the body by some short muscles, and is usually
  much surrounded by fat-body into which tracheae penetrate; by these various means it is kept in
  position, though only loosely attached; beneath it there is a delicate, incomplete or fenestrate,
  membrane, delimiting a sort of space called the pericardial chamber or sinus; connected with this
  membrane are some very delicate muscles, the alary muscles, extending inwards from the body wall
  (<i>b</i>, Fig. 72): the curtain formed by these muscles and the fenestrate membrane is called the
  pericardial diaphragm or septum.  The alary muscles are not directly connected with the heart.</p>

      lower alary.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It has been thought by some that delicate vessels exist beyond the aorta through which the
  fluid is distributed in definite channels, but this does not appear to be really the case,
  although the fluid may frequently be seen to move in definite lines at some distance from the
  heart.</p>

  <p>There is still much uncertainty as to some of the details of the action of the heart, and more
  especially as to the influence of the alary muscles. The effect of the contraction of these must
  be to increase the area of the pericardial chamber by rendering <span class="pagenum"
  id="page135"><span class="smaller">{135}</span></span>its floor or septum less arched, as shown in
  our diagram (Fig. 73), representing a transverse section through the pericardial chamber, <b>H</b>
  being the dorsal vessel with <i>m</i> its suspensory muscles, and <i>s</i> its septum, with
  <i>m</i> the alary muscles. The contraction of these latter would draw the septum into the
  position of the dotted line, thus increasing the area of the sinus above; but as this floor or
  septum is a fenestrated structure, its contraction allows fluid to pass through it to the chamber
  above; thus this arrangement may be looked on as a means of keeping up a supply of fluid to the
  dorsal vessel, the perforated septum, when it contracts, exerting pressure on the tissues below;
  these are saturated with fluid, which passes through the apertures to the enlarged pericardial
  chamber.</p>

  <p>Some misconception has prevailed, too, as to the function of the pericardial chamber. This
  space frequently contains a large quantity of fat-body&mdash;pericardial tissue&mdash;together
  with tracheae, and this has given rise to the idea that it might be lung-like in function; but, as
  Miall and Denny<a id="NtA_58" href="#Nt_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> have pointed out, this is
  erroneous; the tissues in Insects have their own ample supplies of air. It has also been supposed
  that the alary muscles cause the contraction of the heart, but this is not directly the case, for
  they are not attached to it, and it pulsates after they have been severed. It has been suggested
  that the contractions of this vessel are regulated by small ganglia placed on, or in, its
  substance. However this may be, these contractions vary enormously according to the condition of
  the Insect; they may be as many, it is said, as 100 or more in a minute, or they may be very slow
  and feeble, if not altogether absent, without the death of the Insect ensuing.</p>

  <p>The expulsion of the blood from the front of the dorsal vessel seems to be due to the rhythm of
  the contraction of the vessel as well as to its mechanical structure. Bataillon says,<a
  id="NtA_59" href="#Nt_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> confirming an observation of R&eacute;aumur, that at the
  period when the silkworm is about to change to the chrysalis condition, the circulation undergoes
  periodical changes, the fluid moving during some intervals of about ten minutes' duration in a
  reversed direction, while at other times the blood is expelled in front and backwards
  simultaneously, owing apparently to a rhythmical change in the mode of contraction of the dorsal
  vessel.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page136"><span class="smaller">{136}</span></span></div>

  <p class="sp3">As the dorsal vessel consists of a number of distinct chambers, it has been
  suggested that there is normally one of these for each segment of the body; and it appears that
  the total number is sometimes thirteen, which is frequently that of the segments of the body
  without the head. The number of chambers differs, however, greatly, as we have previously stated,
  and cannot be considered to support the idea of an original segmental arrangement of the chambers.
  The dorsal vessel, though in the adult a single organ, arises in the embryo from two lateral,
  widely separated parts which only in a subsequent stage of the embryonic development coalesce in
  the median line.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Fat-Body.</b></p>

  <p>In discussing the tracheae we remarked on the importance of their function and on their
  abundant presence in the body. Equally conspicuous, and perhaps scarcely less important in
  function, is the fat-body, which on opening some Insects, especially such as are in the larval
  stage, at once attracts attention. It consists of masses of various size and indefinite form
  distributed throughout the body, loosely connected together, and more or less surrounding and
  concealing the different organs. The colour varies according to the species of Insect. This
  fat-body is much connected with fine tracheal twigs, so that an organisation extending throughout
  the body is thus formed. It may be looked on as a store of nutritious matter which may be added to
  or drawn on with great rapidity; and it is no doubt on this that many of the internal parasites,
  so common in the earlier stages of Insects' lives, subsist before attacking the more permanent
  tissues of their hosts. There is some reason to suppose that the fat-body may have some potency in
  determining the hunger of the Insect, for some parasitised larvae eat incessantly.</p>

  <p>The matter extracted from the food taken into the stomach of the Insect, after undergoing some
  elaboration&mdash;on which point very little is known&mdash;finds its way into the body-cavity of
  the creature, and as it is not confined in any special vessels the fat-body has as unlimited a
  supply of the nutritive fluid as the other organs: if nutriment be present in much greater
  quantity than is required for the purposes of immediate activity, metamorphosis or reproduction,
  it is no doubt taken up by the <span class="pagenum" id="page137"><span
  class="smaller">{137}</span></span>fat-body which thus maintains, as it were, an independent
  feeble life, subject to the demands of the higher parts of the organisation. It undoubtedly is
  very important in metamorphosis, indeed it is possible that one of the advantages of the larval
  state may be found in the fact that it facilitates, by means of the fat-body, the storage in the
  organisation of large quantities of material in a comparatively short period of time.</p>

  <p class="sp3">A considerable quantity of fat tissue is found in the pericardial sinus, where it
  is frequently of somewhat peculiar form, and is spoken of as pericardial cells, or pericardial
  tissue. Some large cells, frequently of pale yellow colour, and containing no fat, are called
  oenocytes by Wielowiejski. They are connected with the general fat-body, but are not entirely
  mingled with it; several kinds have been already distinguished, and they are probably generally
  present. The phagocytes, or leucocytes, the cells that institute the process of histolysis in the
  metamorphosis of <i>Muscidae</i>, are a form of blood cell; though these cells are amoeboid some
  writers derive them from the fat-body. The cells in the blood have no doubt generally an intimate
  relation with the fat-body, but very little accurate information has been obtained as to these
  important physiological points, though Graber has inaugurated their study.<a id="NtA_60"
  href="#Nt_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Organs of Sex.</b></p>

  <p>The continuation of the species is effected in Insects by means of two sexes, each endowed with
  special reproductive organs. It has been stated that there are three sexes in some
  Insects&mdash;male, female, and neuter; but this is not correct, as the so-called neuters are
  truly sexed individuals,&mdash;generally females,&mdash;though, as a rule, they are not occupied
  with the direct physiological processes for continuing the species.</p>

  <p>The offspring is usually produced in the shape of eggs, which are formed in ovaries. These
  organs consist of egg-tubes, a cluster of which is placed on each side of the body, and is
  suspended, according to Leydig<a id="NtA_61" href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> and others, to the
  tissue connected with the heart by means of the thread-like terminations of the tubes.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page138"><span class="smaller">{138}</span></span></div>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The number of egg-tubes varies greatly in different Insects; there may be only one to each
  ovary (<i>Campodea</i>), but usually the number is greater, and in the queen-bee it is increased
  to about 180. In the Queens of the Termitidae, or white ants, the ovaries take on an extraordinary
  development; they fill the whole of the greatly distended hind-body. Three thousand egg-tubes,
  each containing many hundred eggs, may be found in a Queen Termite, so that, as has been said by
  Hagen,<a id="NtA_62" href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> an offspring of millions in number is
  probable. There is considerable variety in the arrangements for the growth of the eggs in the
  egg-tubes. Speaking concisely, the tubes may be considered to be centres of attraction for
  nutritive material, of which they frequently contain considerable stores. Next to the terminal
  thread, of which we have already spoken, there is a greater or smaller enlargement of the tube,
  called the terminal chamber; and there may also be nutriment chambers, in addition to the
  dilatations which form the egg-chambers proper. Korschelt<a id="NtA_63"
  href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> distinguishes three principal forms of egg-tubes, viz. (1) there
  are no special nutriment chambers, a condition shown in Figure 74; (2) nutriment chambers
  alternate with the egg-chambers, as shown in our Figure of an egg-tube of <i>Dytiscus
  marginalis</i>; (3) the terminal chamber takes on an unusual development, acting as a large
  nutriment chamber, there being no other special nutriment chambers. This condition is found in
  <i>Rhizotrogus solstitialis</i>. The arrangements as to successive or simultaneous production of
  the eggs in the tubes seem to differ in different Insects. In some forms, such as the white ants,
  the process of egg-formation (oogenesis) attains a rapidity that is almost incredible, and is
  continued, it is said, for periods of many months. There is no point in which Insects differ more
  than in that of the number of eggs produced by one <span class="pagenum" id="page139"><span
  class="smaller">{139}</span></span>female. The egg-tubes are connected with a duct for the
  conveyance of the eggs to the exterior, and the arrangements of the tubes with regard to the
  oviduct also vary much. An interesting condition is found in <i>Machilis</i> (see Fig. 94, <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page188">188</a></span>), where the seven egg-tubes are not arranged in a
  bunch, but open at a distance from one another into the elongated duct. The two oviducts usually
  unite into one chamber, called the azygos portion or the uterus, near their termination. There are
  a few Insects (Ephemeridae) in which the two oviducts do not unite, but have a pair of orifices at
  the extremity of the body. Hatchett-Jackson has recently shown<a id="NtA_64"
  href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> that in <i>Vanessa io</i> of the Order Lepidoptera, the paired
  larval oviducts are solid, and are fixed ventrally so as to represent an Ephemeridean stage; that
  the azygos system of ducts and appended structures develop separately from the original oviducts,
  and that they pass through stages represented in other Orders of Insects to the stage peculiar to
  the Lepidoptera. <i>Machilis</i>, according to Oudemans, is a complete connecting link between the
  Insects with single and those with paired orifices.</p>

  <p>There are in different Insects more than one kind of diverticula and accessory glands in
  connexion with the oviducts or uterus; a receptaculum seminis, also called spermatheca, is common.
  In the Lepidoptera there is added a remarkable structure, the bursa copulatrix, which is a pouch
  connected by a tubular isthmus with the common portion of the oviduct, but having at the same time
  a separate external orifice, so that there are two sexual orifices, the opening of the bursa
  copulatrix being the lower or more anterior. The organ called by Dufour in his various
  contributions <i>glande s&eacute;bifique</i>, is now considered to be, in some cases at any rate, a
  spermatheca. The special functions of the accessory glands are still very obscure.</p>

  <p>The ovaries of the female are replaced in the male by a pair <span class="pagenum"
  id="page140"><span class="smaller">{140}</span></span>of testes, organs exhibiting much variety of
  form. The structure may consist of an extremely long and fine convoluted tube, packed into a small
  space and covered with a capsule; or there may be several shorter tubes. As another extreme may be
  mentioned the existence of a number of small follicles opening into a common tube, several of
  these small bodies forming together a testis. As a rule each testis has its own capsule, but cases
  occur&mdash;very frequently in the Lepidoptera&mdash;in which the two testes are enclosed in a
  common capsule; so that there then appears to be only one testis. The secretion of each testis is
  conveyed outwards by means of a slender tube, the vas deferens, and there are always two such
  tubes, even when the two testes are placed in one capsule. The vasa deferentia differ greatly in
  their length in different Insects, and are in some cases many times the length of the body; they
  open into a common duct, the ductus ejaculatorius. Usually at some part of the vas deferens there
  exists a reservoir in the form of a sac or dilatation, called the vesicula seminalis. There are in
  the male, as well as in the female, frequently diverticula, or glands, in connexion with the
  sexual passages; these sometimes exhibit very remarkable forms, as in the common cockroach, but
  their functions are quite obscure. There is, as we have already remarked, extreme variety in the
  details of the structure of the internal reproductive apparatus in the male, and there are a few
  cases in which the vasa deferentia do not unite behind, but terminate in a pair of separate
  orifices. The genus <i>Machilis</i> is as remarkable in the form of the sexual glands and ducts of
  the male as we have already mentioned it to be in the corresponding parts of the female.</p>

  <p>Although the internal sexual organs are only fully developed in the imago or terminal stage of
  the individual life, yet in reality their rudiments appear very early, and may be detected from
  the embryo state onwards through the other preparatory stages.</p>

  <p>The spermatozoa of a considerable number of Insects, especially of Coleoptera, have been
  examined by <span class="pagenum" id="page141"><span
  class="smaller">{141}</span></span>Ballowitz;<a id="NtA_65" href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> they
  exhibit great variety; usually they are of extremely elongate form, thread-like, with curious
  sagittate or simply pointed heads, and are of a fibrillar structure, breaking up at various parts
  into finer threads.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>External Sexual Organs.</b>&mdash;The terminal segments of the body are usually
  very highly modified in connexion with the external sexual organs, and this modification occurs in
  such a great variety of forms as to render it impossible to give any general account thereof, or
  of the organs themselves. Some of these segments&mdash;or parts of the segments, for it may be
  dorsal plates or ventral plates, or both&mdash;may be withdrawn into the interior, and changed in
  shape, or may be doubled over, so that the true termination of the body may be concealed. The
  comparative anatomy of all these parts is especially complex in the males, and has been as yet but
  little elucidated, and as the various terms made use of by descriptive entomologists are of an
  unsatisfactory nature we may be excused from enumerating them. We may, however, mention that when
  a terminal chamber is found, with which both the alimentary canal and the sexual organs are
  connected, it is called a cloaca, as in other animals.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Parthenogenesis.</b></p>

  <p class="sp3">There are undoubted cases in Insects of the occurrence of parthenogenesis, that is,
  the production of young by a female without concurrence of a male. This phenomenon is usually
  limited to a small number of generations, as in the case of the Aphididae, or even to a single
  generation, as occurs in the alternation of generations of many Cynipidae, a parthenogenetic
  alternating with a sexual generation. There are, however, a few species of Insects of which no
  male is known (in Tenthredinidae, Cynipidae, Coccidae), and these must be looked on as perpetually
  parthenogenetic. It is a curious fact that the result of parthenogenesis in some species is the
  production of only one sex, which in some Insects is female, in others male; the phenomenon in the
  former case is called by Taschenberg<a id="NtA_66" href="#Nt_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> Thelyotoky,
  in the latter case Arrhenotoky; Deuterotoky being applied to the cases in which two sexes are
  produced. In some forms of <span class="pagenum" id="page142"><span
  class="smaller">{142}</span></span>parthenogenesis the young are produced alive instead of in the
  form of eggs. A very rare kind of parthenogenesis, called paedogenesis, has been found to exist in
  two or three species of Diptera, young being produced by the immature Insect, either larva or
  pupa.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Glands.</b></p>

  <p class="sp5">Insects are provided with a variety of glands, some of which we have alluded to in
  describing the alimentary canal and the organs of sex; but in addition to these there are others
  in connexion with the outer integument; they may be either single cells, as described by Miall in
  <i>Dicranota</i> larva,<a id="NtA_67" href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> or groups of cells,
  isolated in tubes, or pouches. The minute structure of Insect glands has been to some extent
  described by Leydig;<a id="NtA_68" href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> they appear to be essentially
  of a simple nature, but their special functions are very problematic, it being difficult to obtain
  sufficient of their products for satisfactory examination.</p>

  <p>The processes for the maintenance of the life of the individual are in Insects of less
  proportional importance in comparison with those for the maintenance of the species than they are
  in Vertebrates. The generations of Insects are numerous, and the individuals produced in each
  generation are still more profuse. The individuals have as a rule only a short life; several
  successive generations may indeed make their appearances and disappear in the course of a single
  year.</p>

  <p>Although eggs are laid by the great majority of Insects, a few species nevertheless increase
  their numbers by the production of living young, in a shape more or less closely similar to that
  of the parent. This is well known to take place in the Aphididae or green-fly Insects, whose rapid
  increase in numbers is such a plague to the farmer and gardener. These and some other cases are,
  however, exceptional, and only emphasise the fact that Insects are pre-eminently oviparous.
  Leydig, indeed, has found in the same <i>Aphis</i>, and even in the same ovary, an egg-tube
  producing eggs while a neighbouring tube is producing viviparous individuals.<a id="NtA_69"
  href="#Nt_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> In the Diptera pupipara the young are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page144"><span class="smaller">{144}</span></span>produced one at a time, and are born in the
  pupal stage of their development, the earlier larval state being undergone in the body of the
  parent: thus a single large egg is laid, which is really a pupa.</p>

  <p>The eggs are usually of rather large size in comparison with the parent, and are produced in
  numbers varying according to the species from a few&mdash;15 or even less in some fossorial
  Hymenoptera&mdash;to many thousands in the social Insects: somewhere between 50 and 100 may
  perhaps be taken as an average number for one female to produce. The whole number is frequently
  deposited with rapidity, and the parent then dies at once. Some of the migratory locusts are known
  to deposit batches of eggs after considerable intervals of time and change of locality. The social
  Insects present extraordinary anomalies as to the production of the eggs and the prolongation of
  the life of the female parent, who is in such cases called a queen.</p>

  <p>The living matter contained in the egg of an Insect is protected by three external coats: (1) a
  delicate interior oolemm; (2) a stronger, usually shell-like, covering called the chorion; (3) a
  layer of material added to the exterior of the egg from glands, at or near the time when it is
  deposited, and of very various character, sometimes forming a coat on each egg and sometimes a
  common covering or capsule for a number of eggs. The egg-shell proper, or chorion, is frequently
  covered in whole or part with a complex minute sculpture, of a symmetrical character, and in some
  cases this is very highly developed, forming an ornamentation of much delicacy; hence some
  Insects' eggs are objects of admirable appearance, though the microscope is of course necessary to
  reveal their charms. One of the families of butterflies, the Lycaenidae, is remarkable for the
  complex forms displayed by the ornamentation of the chorion (see Fig. 78, B).</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Formation of Embryo.</b></p>

  <p>The mature, but unfertilised, egg is filled with matter that should ultimately become the
  future individual, and in the process of attaining this end is the seat of a most remarkable
  series of changes, which in some Insects are passed through with extreme rapidity. The
  egg-contents consist of a comparatively structureless matrix of a protoplasmic nature and of yolk,
  both of which are distributed throughout the egg in an approximately even manner. The yolk,
  however, is by no means of a simple nature, but consists, even in a single egg, of two or three
  kinds of spherular or granular constituents; and these vary much in their appearance and
  arrangement in the early stages of the development of an egg, the yolk of the same egg being
  either of a homogeneously granular nature, or consisting of granules and larger masses, as well as
  of particles of fatty matter; these latter when seen through the microscope looking sometimes like
  shining, nearly colourless, globules.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page146"><span class="smaller">{146}</span></span></div>

      by junction of the male and female pronuclei. (After Henking.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The nature of the matrix&mdash;which term we may apply to both the protoplasm and yolk as
  distinguished from the minute formative portions of the egg&mdash;and the changes that take place
  in it have been to some extent studied, and Kowalewsky, Dohrn,<a id="NtA_71"
  href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> Woodworth,<a id="NtA_72" href="#Nt_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> and
  others have given some particulars about them. The early changes in the formative parts of the
  mature egg have been observed by Henking in several Insects, and particularly in
  <i>Pyrrhocoris</i>, his observations being of considerable interest. When the egg is in the ovary
  and before it is quite mature,&mdash;at the time, in fact, when it is receiving nutriment from
  ovarian cells,&mdash;it contains a germinal vesicle including a germinal spot, but when the egg is
  mature the germinal vesicle has disappeared, and there exists in its place at one portion of the
  periphery of the egg-contents a cluster of minute bodies called chromosomes by Henking, whom we
  shall follow in briefly describing their changes. The group divides into two, each of which is
  arranged in a rod or spindle-like manner, and may then be called a directive rod or spindle. The
  outer of these two groups travels quite to the periphery of the egg, and there with some adjacent
  matter is extruded quite outside the egg-contents (not outside the egg-coverings), being in its
  augmented form called a polar or directive body. While this is going on the second directive
  spindle itself divides into two groups, the outer of which is then extruded in the manner we have
  already described in the case of the first polar body, thus completing the extrusion of two
  directive bodies. The essential parts of the bodies that are successively formed during these
  processes are the aggregates, called chromosomes; the number of these chromosomes appears to be
  constant in each species; their movements and dispositions are of a very interesting character,
  the systems they form in <span class="pagenum" id="page147"><span
  class="smaller">{147}</span></span>the course of their development having polar and equatorial
  arrangements. These we cannot further allude to, but may mention that the extrusion of the
  directive bodies is only temporary, they being again included within the periphery of the egg by
  the growth and extension of adjacent parts which meet over and thus enclose the bodies.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The arrangements and movements we have briefly alluded to have been limited to the
  unfertilised condition of the egg (we should rather say, the fertilising element has taken no part
  in them), and have as their result the union of the chromosomes existing after the extrusion of
  the two polar bodies, into a small body called the female pronucleus or egg-nucleus (Eikern),
  while the position of the movements has been an extremely minute portion of the egg near to its
  outer surface or periphery. The introduction of a sperm, or male, element to the egg through the
  micropyle gives rise to the formation of another minute body placed more in the interior of the
  egg, and called the sperm-nucleus. The egg-nucleus, travelling more into the interior of the egg,
  meets the sperm-nucleus; the two amalgamate, forming a nucleus or body that goes through a series
  of changes resulting in its division into two daughter-bodies. These two again divide, and by
  repetitions of such division a large number of nuclei are formed which become arranged in a
  continuous manner so as to form an envelope enclosing a considerable part (if not quite the whole)
  of the egg-mass. This envelope is called the blastoderm, and together with its contents will form
  the embryo. We must merely allude to the fact that it has been considered that some of the nuclei
  forming the blastoderm arise directly from the egg-mass by a process of amalgamation, and if this
  prove to be correct it may be admitted that some portions of the embryo are not entirely the
  result of division or segmentation of combined germ and sperm-nuclei. Wheeler states<a id="NtA_73"
  href="#Nt_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> that some of the nuclei formed by the first differentiation go
  to form the vitellophags scattered throughout the yolk. We should also remark that, according to
  Henking, the blastoderm when completed shows at one part a thickening, immediately under which
  (<i>i.e.</i> included in the area the blastoderm encloses) are the two polar bodies, which, as we
  have seen, were formed by the germinating body at an earlier stage of its activity. Fig. 79 <span
  class="pagenum" id="page148"><span class="smaller">{148}</span></span>represents a stage in the
  development of <i>Pyrrhocoris</i>, showing the interior of the egg after a body has been formed by
  the union of the sperm and egg-nuclei; this body is about to undergo division or segmentation, and
  the equatorial arrangement where this will take place is seen. The two polar bodies P<sub>1</sub>,
  P<sub>2</sub>, after having been excluded, are nearly reincluded in the egg.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>The Ventral Plate.</b></p>

  <p>The next important change after the formation of the blastoderm is the partial detachment of a
  part of its periphery to become placed in the interior of the other and larger portion. The way in
  which this takes place will be gathered from the accompanying diagrammatic figures taken from
  Graber: a thickened portion (<i>a</i> <i>b</i>) of the blastoderm becomes indrawn so as to leave a
  fold (<i>c</i> <i>d</i>) at each point of its withdrawal, and these folds afterwards grow and meet
  so as to enclose the thickened portion. The outer envelope, formed in part by the original
  blastoderm and in part by the new growth, is called the serosa (<i>e</i> <i>f</i>), the inner
  layer (<i>g</i>) of the conjoined new folds being termed the amnion: the part withdrawn to the
  interior and covered by the serosa and amnion is called the ventral plate, or germinal band
  (<i>Keimstreif</i>), and becomes developed into the future animal. The details of the withdrawal
  of the ventral plate to the interior are very different in the various Insects that have been
  investigated.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      part of the serosa; <i>g</i>, amnion.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>One of the earliest stages in the development is a differentiation of a portion of the ventral
  plate into layers from which the future parts of the organisation will be derived. This separation
  of endoderm from ectoderm takes place by a sort of invagination, analogous with that by which the
  ventral plate itself is formed. A longitudinal depression running along the middle of the ventral
  plate appears, and forms a groove or channel, which becomes obliterated as to its outer face by
  the meeting together of the two margins of the groove (except on the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page149"><span class="smaller">{149}</span></span>anterior part, which remains open). The more
  internal layer of the periphery of this closed canal is the origin of the endoderm and its
  derivatives. Subsequently the ventral plate and its derivatives grow so as to form the ventral
  part and the internal organs of the Insect, the dorsal part being completed much later by growths
  that differ much in different Insects; Graber, who has specially investigated this matter,
  informing us<a id="NtA_74" href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> that an astonishing multifariousness
  is displayed. It would appear that the various modes of this development do not coincide with the
  divisions into Orders and Families adopted by any systematists.</p>

  <p>We should observe that the terms ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm will probably be no longer
  applied to the layers of the embryo when embryologists shall have decided as to the nature of the
  derived layers, and shall have agreed as to names for them. According to the nomenclature of
  Graber<a id="NtA_75" href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> the blastoderm differentiates into
  Ectoblast and Endoblast; this latter undergoing a further differentiation into Coeloblast and
  Myoblast. This talented embryologist gives the following table of the relations of the embryonic
  layers and their nomenclature, the first term of each group being the one he proposed to use<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Turning our attention to the origin of the segmentation, that is so marked a feature of Insect
  structure, we find that evidence of division or arrangement of the body into segments appears very
  early, as shown in our Figure of some of the early stages of development of <i>Lina</i> (a
  beetle), Fig. 81. In A the segmentation of the ectoderm has not commenced, but the procephalic
  lobes (<i>P C</i>) are seen; in B the three head segments are distinct, while in C the thoracic
  segmentation has occurred, and that of the abdomen has commenced. Graber considers that in this
  species the abdomen consists of ten segmental lobes, and a terminal piece or telson. According to
  Graber<a id="NtA_77" href="#Nt_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> this is not a primitive condition, but is
  preceded by a division into three or four parts, corresponding with the divisions that will
  afterwards be head, thorax, and abdomen. This primary segmentation, he says, takes place in the
  Hypoblast (Endoderm) layer of the ventral plate; this layer being, in an early stage of the
  development of a common grasshopper (<i>Stenobothrus variabilis</i>), divided into four sections,
  two of which go to form the head, while the others become thorax and abdomen respectively. In
  <i>Lina</i> the primary segmentation is, Graber says, into three instead of four parts. Graber's
  opinion on the primary segmentation does not appear to be generally accepted, and Wheeler, who has
  studied<a id="NtA_78" href="#Nt_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page151"><span class="smaller">{151}</span></span>embryology of another Orthopteron, considers
  it will prove to be incorrect. When the secondary segmentation occurs the anterior of the two
  cephalic divisions remains intact, while the second divides into the three parts that afterwards
  bear the mouth parts as appendages. The thoracic mass subsequently segments into three parts, and
  still later the hind part of the ventral plate undergoes a similar differentiation so as to form
  the abdominal segments; what the exact number of these may be is, however, by no means easy to
  decide, the division being but vague, especially posteriorly, and not occurring all at once, but
  progressing from before backwards.</p>

  <p>The investigations that have been made in reference to the segmentation of the ventral plate do
  not at present justify us in asserting that all Insects are formed from the same number of
  embryonic segments. The matter is summarised by Lowne, to the effect that posterior to the
  procephalic lobes there are three head segments and three thoracic segments, and a number of
  abdominal segments, "rarely less than nine or more than eleven." It will be seen by referring to
  Figure 81 that the segmentation appears, not simultaneously, but progressively from the head
  backwards; this of course greatly increases the difficulty of determining by means of a section
  the real number of segments.</p>

  <p>The later stages in the development of Insects are already proved to be so various that it
  would be impossible to attempt to follow them in detail; but in Fig. 82 we represent a median
  section of the embryo of <i>Zygaena filipendula</i> at the fifth day. It shows well some of the
  more important of the general features of the development at a stage subsequent to those
  represented in Fig. 81, A, B, C. The very distinct stomodaeum (<i>st</i>) and proctodaeum
  (<i>pr</i>) are seen as inflexions of the external wall of the body; the segmentation and the
  development of the <span class="pagenum" id="page152"><span
  class="smaller">{152}</span></span>ventral parts of the embryo are well advanced, while the dorsal
  part of the embryo is still quite incomplete.</p>

  <p>The method of investigation by which embryologists chiefly carry on their researches is that of
  dividing the egg after proper preparation, into a large number of thin sections, which are
  afterwards examined in detail, so as to allow the arrangement to be completely inferred and
  described. Valuable as this method is, it is nevertheless clear that it should, if possible, be
  supplemented by direct observation of the processes as they take place in the living egg: this
  method was formerly used, and by its aid we may still hope to obtain exact knowledge as to the
  arrangements and rearrangements of particles by which the structures develop. Such questions as
  whether the whole formative power in the egg is absolutely confined to one or two small centres to
  which the whole of the other egg contents are merely, as it were, passive accessories, or whether
  an egg is a combination in which some portion of the powers of rearrangement is possessed by other
  particles, as well as the chromosomes, in virtue of their own nature or of their position at an
  early period in the whole, can scarcely be settled without the aid of direct observation of the
  processes during life.</p>

  <p>The importance of the yolk is recognised by most of the recent writers. Nussbaum states
  (<i>loc. cit.</i>) that "scattered yolk-cells associate themselves with the mesoblast cells, so
  that the constituents of the mesoblast have a twofold origin." Wheeler finds<a id="NtA_79"
  href="#Nt_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> that amoeboid cells&mdash;he styles them
  vitellophags&mdash;traverse the yolk and assist in its rearrangement; he insists on the importance
  both as regards quantity and quality of the yolk.</p>

  <p>The eggs of some insects are fairly transparent, and the process of development in them can, to
  a certain extent, be observed by simple inspection with the microscope; a method that was used by
  Weismann in his observations on the embryology of <i>Chironomus</i>. There is a moth (<i>Limacodes
  testudo</i>), that has no objection to depositing its eggs on glass microscope-slides. These eggs
  are about a millimetre long, somewhat more than half that width, are very flat, and the egg-shell
  or chorion is very thin and perfectly transparent. When first laid the contents of this egg appear
  nearly homogeneous and evenly distributed, a finely granular appearance being presented
  throughout; but in <span class="pagenum" id="page153"><span
  class="smaller">{153}</span></span>twenty-four hours a great change is found to have taken place.
  The whole superficial contents of the egg are at that time arranged in groups, having the
  appearance of separate rounded or oval masses, pressed together so as to destroy much of their
  globular symmetry. The egg contents are also divided into very distinct forms, a granular matter,
  and a large number of transparent globules, these latter being the fatty portion of the yolk;
  these are present everywhere, though in the centre there is a space where they are very scanty,
  and they also do not extend quite to the circumference. But the most remarkable change that has
  taken place is the appearance in the middle of the field of an area different from the rest in
  several particulars; it occupies about one-third of the width and one-third of the length; it has
  a whiter and more opaque appearance, and the fat globules in it are fewer in number and more
  indistinct. This area is afterwards seen to be occupied by the developing embryo, the outlines of
  which become gradually more distinct. Fig. 83 gives an idea of the appearance of the egg about the
  middle period of the development. In warm weather the larva emerges from this egg ten or eleven
  days after it has been deposited.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="sp3">The period occupied by the development of the embryo is very different in the
  various kinds of Insects; the blowfly embryo is fully developed in less than twenty-four hours,
  while in some of the Orthoptera the embryonic stage may be prolonged through several months.
  According to Woodworth the blastoderm in <i>Vanessa antiopa</i> is complete in twenty-four hours
  after the deposition of the egg, and the involution of the ventral plate is accomplished within
  three days of deposition.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Metamorphosis.</b></p>

  <p>The ontogeny, or life history of the individual, of Insects is peculiar, inasmuch as a very
  large part of the development takes <span class="pagenum" id="page154"><span
  class="smaller">{154}</span></span>place only late in life and after growth has been completed.
  Insects leave the egg in a certain form, and in that condition they continue&mdash;with, however,
  a greater or less amount of change according to kind&mdash;till growth is completed, when, in many
  cases, a very great change of form takes place. Post-embryonic development, or change of form of
  this kind, is called metamorphosis. It is not a phenomenon peculiar to Insects, but exists to a
  greater or less extent in other groups of the Metazoa; while simpler post-embryonic development
  occurs in nearly all, as in scarcely any complex animals are all the organs completely formed at
  the time the individual becomes possessed of a separate existence. In many animals other than
  Insects the post-embryonic development assumes most remarkable and complex forms, though there are
  perhaps none in which the phenomenon is very similar to the metamorphosis of Insects. The
  essential features of metamorphosis, as exhibited in the great class we are writing of, appear to
  be the separation in time of growth and development, and the limitation of the reproductive
  processes to a short period at the end of the individual life. The peculiar phenomena of the
  post-embryonic development of the white ants show that there exists some remarkable correlation
  between the condition of the reproductive organs and the development of the other parts of the
  organisation. If we take it that the post-embryonic physiological processes of any individual
  Insect are of three kinds,&mdash;growth, development, and reproduction,&mdash;then we may say that
  in the higher Insects these three processes are almost completely separated, and go on
  consecutively, the order being,&mdash;first, growth; second, development; third, reproduction.
  While, if we complete the view by including the processes comprised in the formation of the egg
  and the development therein, the series will be&mdash;(1) oogenesis, or egg-growth; (2)
  development (embryonic); (3) growth (post-embryonic); (4) development (post-embryonic); (5)
  reproduction.</p>

  <p>The metamorphosis of Insects is one of the most interesting parts of entomology. It is,
  however, as yet very little known from a scientific point of view, although the simpler of its
  external characters have for many ages past attracted the attention and elicited the admiration of
  lovers of nature. It may seem incorrect to say that little is yet known scientifically of a
  phenomenon concerning which references almost <span class="pagenum" id="page155"><span
  class="smaller">{155}</span></span>innumerable are to be found in literature: nevertheless the
  observations that have been made as to metamorphosis, and the analysis that has been commenced of
  the facts are at present little more than sufficient to show us how vast and complex is the
  subject, and how great are the difficulties it presents.</p>

  <p class="sp3">There are three great fields of inquiry in regard to metamorphosis, viz. (1) the
  external form at the different stages; (2) the internal organs and their changes; (3) the
  physiological processes. Of these only the first has yet received any extensive attention, though
  it is the third that precedes or underlies the other two, and is the most important. We will say a
  few words about each of these departments of the inquiry. Taking first the external form&mdash;the
  instar. But before turning to this we must point out that in limiting the inquiry to the
  post-embryonic development, we are making one of those limitations that give rise to much
  misconception, though they are necessary for the acquisition of knowledge as to any complex set of
  phenomena. If we assume five well-marked stages as constituting the life of an Insect with extreme
  metamorphosis, viz. (1) the formation and growth of the egg; (2) the changes in the egg
  culminating in its hatching after fertilisation; (3) the period of growth; (4) the pupal changes;
  (5) the life of the perfect Insect; and if we limit our inquiry about development to the latter
  three, we are then shutting out of view a great preliminary question, viz. whether some Insects
  leave the egg in a different stage of development to others, and we are consequently exposing
  ourselves to the risk of forgetting that some of the distinctions we observe in the subsequent
  metamorphosis may be consequential on differences in the embryonic development.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Instar and Stadium.</b></p>

  <p>Figs. 84 and 85 represent corresponding stages in the life of two different Insects, Fig. 84
  showing a locust (<i>Acridium</i>), and Fig. 85 a white butterfly. In each A represents the
  newly-hatched individual; B, the insect just before its perfect state; C, the perfect or imago
  stage. On comparing the two sets of figures we see that the C stages correspond pretty well as
  regards the most important features (the position of the wings being unimportant), that the A
  stages are moderately different, <span class="pagenum" id="page156"><span
  class="smaller">{156}</span></span>while the B states are not to be recognised as equivalent
  conditions.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Every Insect after leaving the egg undergoes during the process of growth castings of the skin,
  each of which is called a moult or ecdysis. Taking for our present purpose five as the number of
  ecdyses undergone by both the locust and butterfly, we may express the differences in the
  successions of change we portray in Figs. 84 and 85 by saying that previous to the first ecdysis
  the two Insects are moderately dissimilar, that the locust undergoes a moderate change before
  reaching the fifth ecdysis, and undergoes another moderate change at this moult, thus reaching its
  perfect condition by a slight, rather gradual series of <span class="pagenum" id="page157"><span
  class="smaller">{157}</span></span>alterations of form. On the other hand, the butterfly undergoes
  but little modification, remaining much in the condition shown by A, Fig. 85, till the fourth, or
  penultimate, ecdysis, but then suffers a complete change of form and condition, which apparently
  is only inferior to another astonishing change that takes place at the fifth or final moult. The
  chief, though by no means the only, difference between the two series consists in the fact that
  the butterfly has interposed between the penultimate and the final ecdyses a completely quiescent
  helpless condition, in which it is deprived of external organs of sense, locomotion, and
  nutrition; while in the locust there is no loss of these organs, and such quiescent period as
  exists is confined to a short period just at the fifth ecdysis. The changes exhibited by the
  butterfly are called "complete metamorphosis," while this phenomenon in the locust is said to be
  "incomplete." The Insect with complete metamorphosis is in its early stage called a larva, and in
  the quiescent state a pupa. The adult state in both butterfly and locust is known as imago or
  perfect Insect.</p>

  <p>The most conspicuous of the differences between Insects with complete and those with incomplete
  metamorphosis is, as we have remarked, the existence in the former of a pupa. The pupal state is
  by no means similar in all the Insects that possess it. The most anomalous conditions in regard to
  it occur in the Order Neuroptera. In some members of that Order&mdash;the Caddis-flies for
  instance&mdash;the pupa is at first quiescent, but becomes active before the last ecdysis; while
  in another division&mdash;the May-flies&mdash;the last ecdysis is not preceded by a formed pupa,
  nor is there even a distinct pupal period, but the penultimate ecdysis is accompanied by a change
  of form to the winged condition, the final ecdysis being merely a casting of the skin after the
  winged state has been assumed. In the <i>Odonata</i> or Dragon-flies there is no pupal stage, but
  the change of form occurring at the last ecdysis is very great. In those Insects where the
  interval between the last two moults is not accompanied by the creature's passing into a definite,
  quiescent pupa, the individual is frequently called then a nymph; but the term nymph has merely a
  distinctive meaning, and is not capable of accurate definition, owing to the variety of different
  conditions covered by the word. Eaton, in describing this term as it is used for
  <i>Ephemeridae</i>, says, "Nymphs are young which lead an <span class="pagenum" id="page158"><span
  class="smaller">{158}</span></span>active life, quitting the egg at a tolerably advanced stage of
  morphological development, and having the mouth-parts formed after the same main type of
  construction as those of the adult insect."<a id="NtA_80" href="#Nt_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The intervals between the ecdyses are called stadia, the first stadium being the period between
  hatching and the first ecdysis. Unfortunately no term is in general use to express the form of the
  Insect at the various stadia; entomologists say, "the form assumed at the first moult," and so on.
  To avoid this circumlocution it may be well to adopt a term suggested by Fischer,<a id="NtA_81"
  href="#Nt_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> and call the Insect as it appears at hatching the first instar,
  what it is as it emerges from the first ecdysis the second instar, and so on; in that case the
  pupa of a Lepidopteron that assumed that condition at the fifth ecdysis would be the sixth instar,
  and the butterfly itself would be the seventh instar.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Various terms are used to express the differences that exist in the metamorphoses
  of Insects, and as these terms refer chiefly to the changes in the outer form, we will here
  mention them. As already stated, the locust is, in our own language, said to have an incomplete
  metamorphosis, the butterfly a complete one. The term Holometabola has been proposed for Insects
  with complete metamorphosis, while the appellations Ametabola, Hemimetabola, Heterometabola, and
  Paurometabola have been invented for the various forms of incomplete, or rather less complex,
  metamorphosis. Some writers use the term Ametabola for Insects that are supposed to exhibit no
  change of external form after quitting the egg, the contrasted series of all other Insects being
  then called Metabola. Westwood and others use the word Homomorpha for Insects in which the
  condition on hatching more or less resembles that attained at the close of the development, and
  Heteromorpha for those in which the form on emergence from the egg differs much from what it
  ultimately becomes.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Hypermetamorphosis.</b></p>

  <p>There are certain unusual changes to which the term hypermetamorphosis has been applied; these
  we can here only briefly allude to.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page159"><span class="smaller">{159}</span></span></div>

  <p>Insects that have complete metamorphoses, and are not supplied with food by their parents or
  guardians, are provided during their larval life with special modifications of extremely various
  kinds to fit them for the period of life during which they are obtaining food and growing. Thus
  caterpillars possess numerous adaptations to fit them for the period during which they live on
  leaves, while maggots have modifications enabling them to live amongst decomposing flesh. Some
  larvae are greatly modified in this adaptive way, and when the adaptations change greatly during
  the life of the larva, hypermetamorphosis is said to exist. As an instance we may mention some
  beetle larvae that are born with legs by whose aid they can cling to a bee, and so get carried to
  its nest, where they will in future live on the stores of food the bee provides for its own young.
  In order that they may be accommodated to their totally different second circumstances, they
  change their first form, losing their legs, and becoming almost bladder-like creatures, fitted for
  floating on the honey without being injured by it. Such an occurrence has been described by
  Fabre<a id="NtA_82" href="#Nt_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> in the case of <i>Sitaris humeralis</i>, and
  his figures have been reproduced in Sir John Lubbock's book on the metamorphoses of Insects,<a
  id="NtA_83" href="#Nt_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> as well as in other works, yet they are of so much
  interest that we give them again, especially as the subject is still only in its infancy; we at
  present see no sufficient reason for the later of these larval states. Little is, we believe,
  known as to the internal anatomy of the various instars in these curious cases.</p>

  <p class="sp3">There are certain minute Hymenoptera that deposit their eggs inside the eggs of
  other Insects, where the beings hatched from the parasitic eggs subsequently undergo their
  development and growth, finding their sustenance in the yolk or embryo contained in the host-egg.
  It is evident that such a life is very anomalous as regards both food and the conditions for
  respiration, and we consequently find that these tiny egg-parasites go through a series of changes
  of form of a most remarkable character.<a id="NtA_84" href="#Nt_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> It would
  appear that in these cases the embryonic and post-embryonic developments are not separated in the
  same way as they are in other Insects. We are not aware that any term has yet been proposed for
  this very curious kind of Insect development, which, as pointed out by Brauer,<a id="NtA_85"
  href="#Nt_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> is doubtless of a different nature from the hypermetamorphosis
  of <i>Sitaris</i>.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Changes in Internal Organs.</b></p>

  <p>In relation to the post-embryonic development of the internal organs of the body there is but
  little exact generalisation to be made, the anatomical condition of these organs at the time of
  emergence from the egg having been ascertained in but few Insects. We know that in Holometabolous
  Insects the internal anatomy differs profoundly in the larval and imaginal instars. As to Insects
  with more imperfect metamorphosis very little information exists, but it appears probable that in
  many no extensive distinctions exist between the newly-hatched and the adult forms, except in the
  condition of the reproductive organs. Differences of minor importance doubtless exist, but there
  is almost no information as to their extent, or as to the periods at which the changes occur; so
  that we do not know to what extent they may be concentrated at the final ecdysis. In Insects with
  perfect metamorphosis the structures of the internal organs are, as we have said, in many cases
  totally different in the larval and imaginal periods of the life; but these changes are far from
  being uniform in all Holometabola. The nervous system in some cases undergoes a great
  concentration of the ganglia, in others does not, and important distinctions exist in this respect
  even within the limits of a single Order, such as the Coleoptera. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page161"><span class="smaller">{161}</span></span>Some Insects take the same kind of food
  throughout their lives, but many others change totally in this respect, and their organs for the
  prehension and digestion of food undergo a corresponding change. Butterflies suck food in the form
  of liquid juices from flowers by means of a delicate and long proboscis, while the young
  butterfly&mdash;the caterpillar&mdash;disdains sweets, and consumes, by the assistance of powerful
  mandibles, a great bulk of leaves. Other Holometabola undergo no such total change of habits; the
  tiger-beetle, for instance, is as ferocious a consumer of the juices of Insects in its young stage
  as it is in the adult condition. Hence Brauer<a id="NtA_86" href="#Nt_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a>
  divides Insects, as regards this point, into three categories. The forms in which both the young
  and adult take food by suction he calls Menorhyncha; those in which both the imago and immature
  forms feed by mandibles he calls Menognatha; while his Metagnatha consists of those insects that
  take food by jaws when young, but by suction with tubular mouths when mature. Besides these main
  divisions there are some exceptional cases to which we need not here allude, our present object
  being to indicate that in the Metagnatha the digestive organs are of a very different nature in
  the young and in the adult states of existence.</p>

  <p>The internal organs for the continuance of the species are known to be present in a rudimentary
  stage in the embryo, and it is a rule that they do not attain their full development until growth
  has been completed; to this rule there may possibly be an exception in the case of the Aptera. But
  little information of a comparative character exists as to the dorsal vessel and the changes it
  undergoes during metamorphosis. There is considerable difficulty in connexion with the examination
  of this structure, but it appears probable that it is one of the organs that changes the least
  during the process of metamorphosis.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The exact nature of the internal changes that occur during metamorphosis is almost
  a modern subject. It is of course a matter of great difficulty to observe and record changes that
  go on in the interior of such small creatures as Insects, and when the phenomena occur with great
  rapidity, as is frequently the case in Insect metamorphosis, the difficulty is much increased.
  Nevertheless the subject is of such great interest that it has been investigated with a skill and
  perseverance that call for the <span class="pagenum" id="page162"><span
  class="smaller">{162}</span></span>highest admiration. The greater part of the information
  obtained refers to a single Insect, the blowfly; and amongst those who have made important
  contributions to it we may mention Weismann,<a id="NtA_87" href="#Nt_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a>
  Viallanes,<a id="NtA_88" href="#Nt_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> Ganin,<a id="NtA_89"
  href="#Nt_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> and Van Rees,<a id="NtA_90" href="#Nt_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a>
  and it is at present under investigation by Lowne. A good deal, too, is becoming known about the
  processes in the case of the silkworm.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Integument and Ecdysis.</b></p>

  <p>The integument consists of a cellular layer, usually called the hypodermis, situated on a
  basement membrane. The hypodermis, or layer of chitinogenous cells, excretes a matter which
  remains attached to the body, forming the hard outer layer of the skin. This layer consists of
  chitin and has no vitality, but its presence no doubt exerts a very important influence on the
  physiological processes of the Insect. The chitinous investment varies much in thickness and in
  other properties; in some Insects it is hard, even glassy, so as to be difficult to pierce with a
  pin, in others it is pliable, and in some very delicate. Chitin is a substance very difficult to
  investigate; according to the recent researches of Krawkow<a id="NtA_91"
  href="#Nt_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> it may prove to be of somewhat variable chemical
  composition.</p>

  <p>After a time the hypodermis excretes a fresh supply of chitin, and, possibly by the
  commencement of this process, the older chitinous investment becomes separated and is shed. The
  details have, however, not been ascertained, though their importance has been suggested by
  Hatchett Jackson.<a id="NtA_92" href="#Nt_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> The newly exposed layer of
  integument is pallid, but afterwards becomes coloured in a manner varying according to the
  species, the process being possibly due to some secondary exudation permeating the freshly exposed
  chitin, or modifying some part of its exterior.</p>

  <p>Lowne informs us that in the imago of the blowfly the great majority of the hypodermic cells
  themselves enter into the composition of the chitinous integument; and it is perhaps not a matter
  for surprise that the cells should die on the completion of their functional activity, and should
  form a part of the chitinous <span class="pagenum" id="page163"><span
  class="smaller">{163}</span></span>investment.  Some writers say that the chitinous layer may be
  shown to be covered by a delicate extima or outer coat.</p>

  <p>The number of ecdyses varies greatly in Insects, but has been definitely ascertained in only a
  few forms outside the Order Lepidoptera. In <i>Campodea</i> Grassi says there is a single
  fragmentary moult, and in many Hymenoptera the skin that is cast is extremely delicate, and the
  process perhaps only occurs twice or three times previous to the pupal stage. In most Insects,
  however, ecdysis is a much more important affair, and the whole of the chitinous integument is
  cast off entire, even the linings of the tracheae, and of the alimentary canal and its adjuncts
  being parted with. Sir John Lubbock observed twenty-three moults in a May-fly of the genus
  <i>Clo&euml;on</i>,<a id="NtA_93" href="#Nt_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> this being the maximum yet
  recorded, though Sommer states<a id="NtA_94" href="#Nt_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a> that in
  <i>Macrotoma plumbea</i> moulting goes on as long as life lasts, even after the Insect has
  attained its full size.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Some Insects get quit of a considerable quantity of matter by their ecdyses, while
  in others the amount is comparatively slight. It has been thought that the moulting is effected in
  order to permit of increase of size of the Insect, but there are facts which point to the
  conclusion that this is only a factor of secondary importance in the matter. One of these is that
  many Insects make their first ecdysis almost immediately after they leave the egg; this is the
  case with the young larva of the blowfly, which, according to Lowne, moults within two hours of
  its emergence from the egg. We have already referred to the important suggestion made by Eisig<a
  id="NtA_95" href="#Nt_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a> that, since chitin is a nitrogenous substance, the
  ecdyses may be a means of getting rid of waste nitrogenous matter; to which we have added that as
  chitin also consists largely of carbon, its excretion may be of importance in separating
  carbonaceous products from the blood.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Metamorphosis of Blowfly.</b></p>

  <p>The phenomena of metamorphosis are displayed to their greatest extent in the transformations
  and physiological processes of the <i>Muscid Diptera</i>, of which the common blowfly is an <span
  class="pagenum" id="page164"><span class="smaller">{164}</span></span>example. We will briefly
  consider the information that has been obtained on this subject.</p>

  <p>The development of the embryo in the egg of the blowfly is unusually rapid, occupying only a
  period of twenty to twenty-four hours. After its first moult the blowfly larva grows rapidly
  during a period of about ten to fourteen days, during which it undergoes moults, the number of
  which appears not to be definitely ascertained. After becoming full-fed the larva loses its active
  state, and passes for a period into a condition of comparative quiescence, being spoken of in this
  state as a resting larva. This quiet period occurs in most full-grown larvae, and is remarkable
  for the great variation that may occur in its duration, it being in many Insects subject to
  prolongation for months, in some cases possibly even for years, though in favourable circumstances
  it may be very short. Lowne informs us that in the blowfly this period of the life is occupied by
  very great changes in the internal organs, which are undergoing very extensive processes of
  destruction and rebuilding. After some days the outer skin of the resting larva shrivels, and is
  detached from the internal living substances, round which it hardens and forms the sort of cocoon
  or capsule that is so well known. This using of the cast larval skin as a cocoon is, however,
  limited to certain of the two-winged flies, and perhaps a few other Insects, and so must be
  considered an exceptional condition. The capsule conceals from view a most remarkable state, known
  to the old naturalist R&eacute;aumur as the "spheroidal condition," but called by more recent writers the
  pronymph. The pronymphal state may be looked on as being to a great extent a return of the animal
  to the condition of an egg, the creature becoming an accumulation of soft creamy matter enclosed
  in a delicate skin. This spheroidal condition, however, really begins in the resting larva, and
  Van Rees and others think that the delicate membrane enclosing the substance of the pronymph is
  really the hypodermis of the integument of the larva. Although this seems probable, from the
  resemblance this condition would in that case present to the phenomena usual in ecdysis, it is not
  generally admitted, and there is much difficulty in settling the point. Lowne is of a contrary
  opinion, looking on the limiting membrane as a subsequent formation; he calls it the paraderm. The
  process of forming the various organs goes on in the pronymph, till the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page165"><span class="smaller">{165}</span></span>"nymph" has completed its development, the
  creature having then again taken on a definite form which apparently corresponds to the pupa of
  Hymenoptera. Great doubt, however, exists as to this equivalence, and indeed as to any exact
  correspondence between the metamorphic stadia of different Insects, a view which long since was
  expressed by Sir John Lubbock<a id="NtA_96" href="#Nt_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> and Packard. The
  term nymph is used in this case not because there is any resemblance to the condition similarly
  named in Insects with less complete metamorphosis, but because the term pupa is applied to the
  outer case together with the contained nymph. The transformation of the nymph into the perfect
  blowfly occupies a period very variable according to the temperature.</p>

  <p><b>Histolysis.</b>&mdash;The processes by which the internal organs of the maggot are converted
  into those of the fly are of two kinds,&mdash;histolysis or breaking down, histogenesis or
  building up, of tissue. The intermediary agents in histolysis are phagocytes, cells similar to the
  leucocytes or white corpuscles of the blood: the intermediary agents in histogenesis are portions
  of tissue existing in the larval state incorporated with the different organs, or preserving a
  connexion therewith even when they are to a great extent separated therefrom. In this latter case
  they are called imaginal discs, though Professor Miall prefers to term them imaginal folds.<a
  id="NtA_97" href="#Nt_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> The two processes of histolysis and histogenesis,
  though to some extent mutually dependent (for the material to be built up has to be largely
  obtained by previous destruction), do not go on <i>pari passu</i>, though they are to a great
  extent contemporaneous. In the resting larva histolysis is predominant, while in the nymph
  histogenesis is more extensive. Microscopic observation shows that the phenomena connected with
  the histolysis of the muscular tissue are scarcely distinguishable from those of an inflammatory
  process, and Viallanes<a id="NtA_98" href="#Nt_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> dilates on this fact in an
  instructive manner. The phagocytes attach themselves to, or enter, the tissues which are to be
  disintegrated, and becoming distended, assume a granular appearance. By this pseudo-inflammatory
  process the larval structures are broken down into a creamy substance; the buds, or germs, from
  which the new organs are to be developed being exempt from the destruction. These buds, of which
  about sixty or upwards have already been detected, undergo <span class="pagenum"
  id="page166"><span class="smaller">{166}</span></span>growth as they are liberated, and so the new
  creature is formed, the process of growth in certain parts going on while destruction is being
  accomplished in others. Considerable discrepancy prevails as to the extent to which the
  disintegration of some of the tissues is carried.</p>

  considerable extent, according to Bugnion<a id="NtA_100" href="#Nt_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> and
  others, in the metamorphosis of Lepidoptera. Indeed it would almost seem that the processes of
  histolysis and histogenesis may be looked on as exaggerated forms of the phenomena of the ordinary
  life of tissues, due to greater rapidity and discontinuity of tissue nutrition.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Both the regenerative buds and the rudimentary sexual glands are known to be derived directly
  from the embryo; neither of them undergoes any histolysis, so that we have in them embryonic
  structures which exist in a quiescent condition during the period in which the larva is growing
  with great rapidity, and which when the larva has attained its full growth and is disintegrating,
  then <span class="pagenum" id="page168"><span class="smaller">{168}</span></span>appropriate the
  products of the disintegration so as to produce the perfect fly.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Our Fig. 88, taken from Graber, represents a longitudinal median section of a
  full-grown larva of <i>Musca</i>, in which the processes of metamorphosis are taking place. The
  position of some of the more important imaginal rudiments is shown by it: <i>b<sup>1</sup></i>,

  <p class="ac"><b>Physiology of Metamorphosis.</b></p>

  <p>Many years ago, Harvey perceived the probable existence of a physiological continuity between
  the earlier and later stages of the Insect's life. Modern investigation has shown that in the
  blowfly a remarkable analogy exists between the conditions of the pupa and the egg. The outer
  shell of the pupa corresponds to the chorion or egg-shell, and the delicate outer membrane of the
  pronymph to the oolemn or lining membrane of the egg; the creamy matter corresponds with the yolk,
  and the regenerative buds are analogous to the formative portions of the developing egg. The
  process of histolysis as carried out by the phagocytes of the later life appears also to find a
  parallel in the vitellophags of the embryonic life.<a id="NtA_106"
  href="#Nt_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> It appears probable that the physiological processes of the
  post-embryonic metamorphosis may be essentially a repetition&mdash;or an interrupted
  continuation&mdash;of those of the embryonic period.</p>

  <p>The inquiry as to what are the determining causes of the metamorphic changes of the blowfly and
  other Insects has as yet but little advanced. Why does the larva grow up to a certain period with
  great rapidity, then cease its appropriating power and break up the parts that have been so
  rapidly and recently formed? And why do the imaginal buds remain quiescent till the other tissues
  are being disintegrated, and then, instead of sharing the general condition of disintegration,
  commence a career of development? To these questions no satisfactory answer has yet been given,
  though the remarkable studies, already referred to, of Bataillon on the later larval life <span
  class="pagenum" id="page169"><span class="smaller">{169}</span></span>of the silkworm suggest the
  direction in which knowledge may be found, for they show that the physiological conditions of the
  later larval life are different from those of the earlier life, possibly as the direct result of
  the mere aggregation of matter, and the consequent different relations of the parts of the
  organism to atmospheric and aqueous conditions.</p>

  <p>If we wish to understand metamorphosis, we must supplement the old opinion that ecdysis is
  merely an occurrence to facilitate expansion, by the more modern conception that it is also an
  important physiological process. That shedding the skin is done solely to permit of enlargement of
  size is a view rendered untenable by many considerations. The integument can increase and stretch
  to an enormous extent without the aid of moulting; witness the queen-termite, and the
  honey-bearers of the <i>Myrmecocystus</i> ants. Many moults are made when increase of size does
  not demand them, and the shedding of the skin at the time of pupation is accompanied by a decrease
  in size. And if moulting be merely connected with increase of size, it is impossible to see why
  <i>Clo&euml;on</i> should require two dozen moults, while <i>Campodea</i> can do with one, or why a
  collembolon should go on moulting during the period of life subsequent to the cessation of
  growth.</p>

  <p>The attention of entomologists has been chiefly directed to the ecdyses connected with the
  disclosure of the pupal and imaginal instars. Various important transformations may, however,
  occur previous to this, and when they do so it is always in connexion with ecdyses. Caterpillars
  frequently assume a different appearance and change their habits or character at a particular
  ecdysis; and in Orthoptera each ecdysis is accompanied by a change of form of the thoracic
  segments; this change is very considerable at one of the intermediate ecdyses.</p>

  <p>The assumption of the pupa state is the concomitant of an ecdysis, and so also is the
  appearance of the imago; but the commencement of each of these two stages precedes the ecdysis,
  which is merely the outward mark of the physiological processes. The ecdysis by which the pupa is
  revealed occurs after the completion of growth and when great changes in the internal organs have
  occurred and are still taking place; the ecdysis by which the imago appears comes after
  development has been quite or nearly completed.</p>

  <p>Although the existence of a pupa is to the eye the most <span class="pagenum"
  id="page170"><span class="smaller">{170}</span></span>striking of the differences between Insects
  with perfect and those with imperfect metamorphosis, yet there is reason for supposing that the
  pupa and the pupal period are really of less importance than they at first sight appear to be. In
  Fig. 85 we showed how great is the difference in appearance between the pupa and the imago. The
  condition that precedes the appearance of the pupa is, however, really the period of the most
  important change. In Fig. 89 we represent the larva and pupa of a bee; it will be seen that the
  difference between the two forms is very great, while the further change that will be required to
  complete the perfect Insect is but slight. When the last skin of the larva of a bee or of a beetle
  is thrown off, it is, in fact, the imago that is revealed; the form thus displayed, though
  colourless and soft, is that of the perfect Insect; what remains to be done is a little shrinking
  of some parts and expansion of others, the development of the colour, the hardening of certain
  parts. The colour appears quite gradually and in a regular course, the eyes being usually the
  first parts to darken. After the coloration is more or less perfected&mdash;according to the
  species&mdash;a delicate pellicle is shed or rubbed off, and the bee or beetle assumes its final
  form, though usually it does not become active till after a farther period of repose.</p>

  CLASSIFICATION&mdash;CLASSIFICATIONS BASED ON METAMORPHOSIS&mdash;SUPER-ORDERS&mdash;THE
  SUBDIVISIONS OF ORDERS.</span></p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Classification.</b></p>

  <p class="sp3">We have already alluded to the fact that Insects are the most numerous in species
  and individuals of all land animals: it is estimated that about 250,000 species have been already
  described and have had scientific names given to them, and it is considered that this is probably
  only about one-tenth of those that really exist. The classification in a comprehensible manner of
  such an enormous number of forms is, it will be readily understood, a matter of great difficulty.
  Several methods or schemes have since the time of Linnaeus been devised for the purpose, but we
  shall not trouble the reader to consider them, because most of them have fallen into disuse and
  have only a historical interest. Even at present there exists, however, considerable diversity of
  opinion on the question of classification, due in part to the fact that some naturalists take the
  structure of the perfect or adult Insect as the basis of their arrangement, while others prefer to
  treat the steps or processes by which the structure is attained, as being of primary importance.
  To consider the relative values of these two methods would be beyond our scope, but as in practice
  a knowledge of the structures themselves must precede an inquiry as to the phases of development
  by which the structures are reached; and as this latter kind of knowledge has been obtained in the
  case of a comparatively small portion of the known forms,&mdash;the embryology and metamorphosis
  having been investigated in but <span class="pagenum" id="page172"><span
  class="smaller">{172}</span></span>few Insects,&mdash;it is clear that a classification on the
  basis of structure is the only one that can be at present of practical value. We shall therefore
  for the purposes of this work make use of an old and simple system, taking as of primary
  importance the nature of the organs of flight, and of the appendages for the introduction of food
  to the body by the perfect Insect. We do not attempt to disguise the fact that this method is open
  to most serious objections, but we believe that it is nevertheless at present the most simple and
  useful one, and is likely to remain such, at any rate as long as knowledge of development is in
  process of attainment.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Orders.</b></p>

  <p>The great groups of Insects are called Orders, and of these we recognise nine, viz. (1) Aptera,
  (2) Orthoptera, (3) Neuroptera, (4) Hymenoptera, (5) Coleoptera, (6) Lepidoptera, (7) Diptera, (8)
  Thysanoptera, (9) Hemiptera. These names are framed to represent the nature of the wings; and
  there is some advantage in having the Orders named in a uniform and descriptive manner. The system
  we adopt differs but little from that proposed by Linnaeus.<a id="NtA_107"
  href="#Nt_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a> The great Swedish naturalist did not, however, recognise the
  Orders Orthoptera and Thysanoptera; and his order Aptera was very different from ours.</p>

  <p>These Orders may be briefly defined as follows,&mdash;the reader being asked to recall the fact
  that by a mandibulate mouth we understand one in which the mandibles, or the maxill&aelig;, or both, are
  fitted for biting, crushing, or grasping food; while the term suctorial implies that some of the
  mouth parts are of a tubular form or are protrusible as a proboscis, which assists, or protects, a
  more minute and delicate sucking apparatus<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>We must again ask the reader to bear in mind that numerous exceptions exist to these characters
  in most of the great Orders; for instance, wingless forms are not by any means rare in several of
  the Orders.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Before remarking further on this system we will briefly sketch two other

  <p class="sp3">Although this system of the Orders of Insects has some valuable features it is open
  to very serious objections, to which we can only briefly allude. The Order Hemiptera with its
  extensive divisions, Heteroptera, Homoptera, Coccidae, and Anoplura exhibiting great differences
  in structure and considerable divergence in metamorphosis, is treated as only equivalent to the
  little group Panorpatae (scorpion-flies); these latter being considered a distinct order, although
  they are not very different in structure or metamorphosis from the Orders he calls Neuroptera and
  Trichoptera. The arrangement appears to be specially designed with the view of making the Orders
  adopted in it fall into the two groups Ametabola and Metabola. The propriety of such a course is
  more than doubtful since very few of the Ametabola are really without metamorphosis, in the wide
  sense of that term, while the Metabola include Insects with various kinds of metamorphosis. Indeed
  if we substitute for the term Ametabola the more correct expression, "Insects with little
  metamorphosis," and for Metabola the definition, "Insects with more metamorphosis but of various
  kinds," we then recognise that the arrangement <span class="pagenum" id="page175"><span
  class="smaller">{175}</span></span>is, like all others, a quite artificial one, while it is of
  little value, owing to the development of so few Insects being hitherto fully ascertained.</p>

  <p>The chief characters on which Brauer bases his system are: (1) The existence or absence of
  wings. (2) The condition of the mouth, and whether it undergoes radical changes in the ontogeny,
  arriving thus at the categories Menognatha, Metagnatha, and Menorhyncha, as we have mentioned on
  <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page161">161</a></span>. (3) The metamorphosis; the grouping
  adopted being Ametabola, Hemimetabola, Metabola. (4) The number of the Malpighian tubules;
  Oligonephria, Polynephria. (5) The nature of the wings, the relative proportions of the thoracic
  segments, and some other characters.</p>

  <p>Brauer's treatise is accompanied by a valuable and in many respects very sagacious
  consideration of the generalised characters of the Insecta; as a classification based partly on
  generalisations and partly on structures, it is, so far as the present <span class="pagenum"
  id="page176"><span class="smaller">{176}</span></span>condition of our knowledge goes, a good one.
  But it is of little value as a practical guide, and as a basis for theoretical speculation it
  cannot be treated as of importance, because the generalisations it makes use of are premature,
  owing to the small proportion of the forms that have been examined. And even now the groups
  adopted are known to be subject to many exceptions.</p>

  <p>Thus it begins by a division of Insecta into winged and wingless; but the winged division is
  made to comprehend an enormous number of wingless Insects, whole subdivisions of Orders such as
  the Mallophaga being placed in the winged series, although all are without wings. This first
  division is indeed entirely theoretical; and if a classification on generalisations were adopted,
  it would be more natural to begin with the old division into Homomorpha and Heteromorpha, and
  treat the Order Aptera as the first division of the Homomorpha, while the Heteromorpha would
  commence with the Ephemeridae and Odonata, in which, though the individual in the early part of
  the ontogeny is very different from the perfect Insect, there is no marked division of the later
  larval and the pupal stages. Brauer's system is also defective inasmuch as it takes no account of
  the embryological or oogenetic processes, though these are of equal importance with the later
  phases of the Ontogeny. Even as regards the division into Orders, it is far from being free from
  reproach; for instance, the separation of the Dermaptera from the Orthoptera, while Rhynchota
  remains intact, although including a more extensive series of heterogeneous forms; the division of
  the Neuroptera into widely separated groups, each of which is treated as equivalent to the great
  Orders, such as Coleoptera (in which Strepsiptera are included), Hymenoptera, and Diptera, is not
  reasonable. The association of Mallophaga and Termitidae, while Dermaptera are separated from
  Orthoptera, is also undeniably arbitrary, and other similar disparities are to be seen on
  scrutinising the details of the system.</p>

  <p>On comparing the three arrangements we have outlined, it will be seen that the chief
  discrepancies they present come under two heads: (1) The treatment of the Neuroptera, opinions
  differing as to whether these Insects shall be grouped as a single Order, or shall be divided into
  numerous Orders; and as to what, if this latter course be adopted, the divisions shall be. (2) The
  treatment of the parasitic groups Mallophaga, Aphaniptera, etc. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page177"><span class="smaller">{177}</span></span>It must be admitted that whichever of the
  three systems we have sketched be adopted, the result is, as regards both these points, open to
  criticism. The Order Neuroptera, if we take it in the broad sense, differs from the other Orders
  in the greater variety of metamorphosis exhibited by its members; while if, on the contrary, it be
  dismembered, we get a number of groups of very unequal extent and not distinguished from one
  another by the same decisive and important characters as are the other Orders of which they are
  considered equivalent. The discrepancy exists in nature, and can scarcely be evaded by any system.
  A similar observation may be made as to the parasitic groups, viz. Mallophaga, Anoplura,
  Aphaniptera, and Strepsiptera. If these be treated as separate Orders the result is not
  satisfactory; while, if they be associated with the larger groups to which they are respectively
  nearest allied, it is almost equally unsatisfactory.</p>

  <p>We may mention that Packard and Brauer have in their treatises discussed the question of
  super-orders, and have gone so far as to propose names for them. These two authorities do not
  however agree in their conclusions; and as the names proposed are of little practical value, and
  are but rarely met with, we need not explain them or discuss the comparative merits of the two
  systems.</p>

  <p>The divisions of inferior value to the Order are, after repeated scrutiny by many naturalists,
  becoming of a more satisfactory character, and notwithstanding various anomalies, may be, many of
  them, considered fairly natural.<a id="NtA_111" href="#Nt_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> Unfortunately
  entomologists have not been able to agree on a system of terminology, so that for these
  subdivisions terms such as sub-order, series, legion, section, tribe, etc., are used by different
  authorities in ways so various as to cause much confusion. In the following pages the terms
  sub-order and series will be used in a somewhat vague manner, the term sub-order being preferred
  where the group appears to be an important one and of a fairly natural character, while the word
  series will be adopted when the groups are connected in a conventional manner. The designation
  "family" will be used for groups of subordinate importance; and as regards this term we may remark
  that systematic entomologists are making genuine efforts to define the "families" in an accurate
  and comprehensible manner. The endeavour to make these systematic <span class="pagenum"
  id="page178"><span class="smaller">{178}</span></span>families dependent throughout the Class
  Insecta on characters of similar morphological value has, however, scarcely been entered on, and
  it is perhaps not desirable, seeing how very small a portion of the Insects of the world have been
  critically examined, that much effort should be yet expended on an attempt of the kind. It must be
  admitted that the species of Insects should be obtained before they can be satisfactorily
  classified, and it is estimated<a id="NtA_112" href="#Nt_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> that at least
  nine-tenths of the Insects of the world are still unknown to entomologists.</p>

  <p><b>Geological Record.</b>&mdash;Although Insects have a very long pedigree, it is as yet a very
  imperfect one. The remains of creatures that can be referred to the Class Insecta have been found,
  it is said, in Silurian strata; only one or two of these very early forms are at present known,
  and the information about them is by no means satisfactory; if Insects at all&mdash;as to which
  some doubt exists&mdash;they apparently belong to very different forms, though, like all the
  earliest fossil Insects, they are winged. In the strata of the Carboniferous epoch numerous
  Insects have been detected, in both Europe and North America. These earlier Insects are by Scudder
  called Palaeodictyoptera, and separated from the Insects around us on the ground that he considers
  there existed amongst these palaeozoic Insects no ordinal distinctions such as obtain in the
  existing forms, but that the primeval creatures formed a single group of generalised Hexapods.
  Brauer does not accept this view, considering that the earlier Insects can be referred to families
  existing at the present time and forming parts of the Orthoptera, Neuroptera, and Hemiptera. The
  discrepancy between these two authorities depends to a great extent on the different
  classifications of existing Insects that they start from; Scudder treating the wings as of primary
  importance, while Brauer assigns to them only a subordinate value. From the point of view taken in
  the present work Scudder's view appears to be in the main correct, though his expression as to the
  primary fossil Insects forming a single homogeneous group is erroneous. The Neuroptera, still in
  existence, certainly form a heterogeneous group, and it is clear that the Palaeozoic fossils
  represent a more diverse assemblage than the present Neuroptera do.<a id="NtA_113"
  href="#Nt_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page179"><span class="smaller">{179}</span></span></div>

  <p>In the more recent rocks Insect remains become comparatively numerous, and in Mesozoic strata
  forms that can satisfactorily be referred to existing Orders are found, the Palaeodictyoptera of
  Goldenberg and Scudder having mostly disappeared; the Blattidae or cockroaches do not apparently
  present any great discontinuity between their Palaeozoic and Mesozoic forms. The Tertiary rocks
  afford us fairly satisfactory evidence to the effect that Insects were then more numerous in
  species than they are at the present day. At Florissant in Colorado the bed of an ancient lake has
  been discovered, and vast quantities of Insect remains have been found in it, the geographical
  conditions indicating that the creatures were not brought from a distance, but were the natural
  fauna of the locality; and if so we can only conclude that Insects must have been then more
  abundant in species than they are now.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Scudder has informed us<a id="NtA_114" href="#Nt_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a> that not
  only were Insects abundant in the Tertiaries, but that their remains indicate conditions of
  existence very similar to what we find around us. "Certain peculiarities of secondary sexual
  dimorphism accompanying special forms of communistic life, such as the neuters and workers in
  Hymenoptera and the soldiers among the Termitina, are also found, as would be expected, among the
  fossils, at least through the whole series of the Tertiaries. The same may be said of other sexual
  characteristics, such as the stridulating organs of the Orthoptera, and of peculiarities of
  oviposition, as seen in the huge egg-capsules of an extinct Sialid of the early Tertiaries. The
  viviparity of the ancient Aphides is suggested, according to Buckton, by the appearance of one of
  the specimens from the Oligocene of Florissant, while some of the more extraordinary forms of
  parasitism are indicated at a time equally remote by the occurrence in amber of the triungulin
  larva of <i>Meloe</i>, already alluded to, and of a characteristic strepsipterous Insect; not
  only, too, are the present tribes of gall-making Insects abundant in the Tertiaries, but their
  galls as well have been found."</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order I. Aptera.</b></p>

  <div class="fine sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Small Insects with weak outer skin, destitute throughout life of wings or
    their rudiments, but with three pairs of legs; antennae large or moderate in size.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>The above definition is the only one that can at present be framed to apply to all the Insects
  included in our Aptera. Unfortunately it is far from diagnostic, for it does not enable us to
  distinguish the Aptera from the larvae or young individuals of many Insects of other Orders. There
  are, however, certain characters existing in many species of Aptera that enable their possessors
  to be recognised with ease, though, as they are quite wanting in other members, they cannot
  correctly be included in a definition applying to the whole of the Order.</p>

  <p>We are thus brought in view of two of the most important generalisations connected with the
  Aptera, viz. that these Insects in their external form remain throughout their life in a condition
  resembling the larval state of other Insects, and that they nevertheless exhibit extreme variety
  in structural characters.</p>

  <p>The more important of the special characters alluded to above <span class="pagenum"
  id="page181"><span class="smaller">{181}</span></span>as being possessed by some but not by all
  members of the Order are (1) a remarkable leaping apparatus, consisting of two elongate processes
  at the under side of the termination of the body; (2) a peculiar ventral tube, usually seen in the
  condition of a papilla with invaginated summit, and placed on the first abdominal segment (see
  Fig. 100, <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page194">194</a></span>); (3) the scales covering the
  body; (4) the existence of abdominal appendages in the form of long cerci or processes at the
  termination of the body, or of short processes on the sides of the under surface of the abdominal
  segments.</p>

  <p>Throughout the Order the general shape approximates to that of a larva; this is shown by the
  diagrammatic section of the body of <i>Machilis</i> (Fig. 90). There is a succession of rings
  differing little from one another, except so far as the head is concerned; even the division of
  thorax from abdomen is but little evident, and although in some of the forms the three thoracic
  segments may differ considerably among themselves, yet they never assume the consolidated form
  that they do to a greater or less extent in the imago stage of the other Orders. Fig. 90 shows the
  larva-like structure of the body, and also exhibits the inequalities in size between some of the
  dorsal and the corresponding ventral plates. This phenomenon is here displayed only to a small
  extent, so that the true relations of the dorsal and ventral plates can be readily detected; but
  in the higher Insects want of correspondence of this kind may be much more extensive.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The respiratory system is in many of these Insects very inferior in development, and may even
  be, so far as tracheae and spiracles are concerned, entirely absent, but in other members of the
  Aptera it is well developed. In the other internal organs there is also great variety, as there is
  in the external structure.</p>

  <p>A brief explanation as to the term Aptera, which we have adopted as the name of this Order, is
  necessary. This name was used by Linnaeus for our Insects, but as he associated with them various
  other heterogeneous forms which were afterwards separated, his "Aptera" became completely broken
  up and ceased <span class="pagenum" id="page182"><span class="smaller">{182}</span></span>to be
  recognised as an Order of Insects. The term was, however, revived by Haeckel and Balfour several
  years since, and applied quite properly to the Insects we have in view. Subsequently Packard and
  Brauer, recognising the claims of these Insects to an isolated position, proposed for them the
  names Synaptera and Apterygogenea, and Packard has also used the term Cinura. There is, however,
  clearly an advantage in retaining the termination "ptera" for each of the Orders of Insects; and
  as the fact that "Aptera" of Linnaeus included many Insects is not a sufficient reason for
  refusing to apply the term to a portion of the forms he used it for, we may, it is clear, make use
  of the Linnaean name with propriety, it being explicitly stated that the Order does not include by
  any means all the apterous forms of Insects.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Order includes two sub-orders, viz. (1) <i>Thysanura</i>, in which the hind
  body (abdomen) is composed of ten segments, and there is no ventral tube on its first segment; and
  (2) <i>Collembola</i>, in which the hind body consists of not more than six segments, the first of
  which is furnished beneath with a peculiar tube or papilla.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Thysanura.</b></p>

  <p>Our knowledge of this important sub-order has been recently much increased by the works of
  Grassi<a id="NtA_115" href="#Nt_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> and Oudemans.<a id="NtA_116"
  href="#Nt_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a> Very little is known, however, of the extra-European forms,
  there being great difficulties in the way of collecting and preserving specimens of these Insects
  in such a way as to render them available for study and accurate comparison. Grassi and Rovelli<a
  id="NtA_117" href="#Nt_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a> recognise four families among the few European
  species of Thysanura, viz. Campodeidae, Japygidae, Machilidae, Lepismidae. Campodeidae is perhaps
  limited to a single species, only one having been satisfactorily established, though several
  descriptions have been made of what are supposed to be other species.</p>

  <p>This Insect (<i>Campodea staphylinus</i>) is, so far as external form goes, well known, from
  its having been figured in many works on natural history on account of its having been supposed to
  be <span class="pagenum" id="page183"><span class="smaller">{183}</span></span>the nearest living
  representative of a primitive or ancestral Insect. The creature itself is but little known even to
  entomologists, although it is one of the commonest of Insects over a large part of Europe. It is
  numerous in the gardens and fields about London and Cambridge, and abounds in damp decaying wood
  in the New Forest; if there be only one species, it must possess an extraordinary capacity for
  adapting itself to extremes of climate, as we have found it at midsummer near the shores of the
  Mediterranean in company with the subtropical white ants, and within a day or two of the same time
  noticed it to be abundant on the actual summit of Mount Canigou, one of the higher Pyrenees, where
  the conditions were almost arctic, and it was nearly the only Insect to be found. The species is
  said to exist also in North America and in East India. It is a fragile, soft Insect of white
  colour, bending itself freely to either side like a Myriapod; the legs are rather long, the
  antennae are long and delicate, and the two processes, or cerci, at the other extremity of the
  body are remarkably similar to antennae. It has no eyes and shuns the light, disappearing very
  quickly in the earth after it has been exposed. If placed in a glass tube it usually dies
  speedily, and is so extremely delicate that it is difficult to pick it up even with a camel's hair
  brush without breaking it; so that we may fear it to be almost hopeless to get enough specimens
  from different parts of the world to learn what differences may exist amongst the individuals of
  this so-called primitive Insect. Meinert, a very able entomologist, considers that there is really
  more than one species of <i>Campodea</i>.</p>

      Lubbock, &times; 15.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Campodeidae as a family may be briefly defined as Thysanura with the trophi buried in the head
  and with the body terminated by antenna-like processes. We shall consider some of the anatomical
  peculiarities of this interesting Insect after we have <span class="pagenum" id="page184"><span
  class="smaller">{184}</span></span>briefly reviewed some of the external characters of the other
  Thysanura.</p>

  <p>The second family (Japygidae) consists of one genus <i>Japyx</i>, of which there are, no doubt,
  several different species in various parts of the world, such having already been detected in
  tropical Africa, in Malasia, and in Mexico, as well as in Madeira and Europe. The commoner species
  of the latter continent, <i>Japyx solifugus</i>, lives in moss or in shady places on the edges of
  woods. It possesses a great resemblance to a newly-hatched earwig, and the writer has found it in
  France under a stone in company with a number of the tiny creatures it was so much like. This
  species has been found as far north as Paris, but has not been met with in Britain. The family
  Japygidae is, like the Campodeidae, entotrophous, and is distinguished by the body being
  terminated behind by a pair of forceps instead of antennary organs.</p>

  <p>The other two families of Thysanura, Machilidae and Lepismidae, are ectotrophous&mdash;that is,
  the parts of the mouth are not buried in the head, but are arranged in the fashion usual in
  mandibulate Insects.</p>

  <p>Only one genus of Machilidae is known, but it is no doubt very numerous in species, and
  probably is distributed over most of the globe. <i>Machilis maritima</i> is common in some places
  on the coast of England. Another species (<i>M. polypoda</i>) occurs amongst dead leaves in the
  New Forest, and we have also observed a species of the genus under the loose stones that
  frequently form the tops of the "dykes" or piled walls in Scotland. In more southern Europe
  species of <i>Machilis</i> are commonly met with on the perpendicular faces of very large stones
  or rocks, over which they glide with wonderful facility. The scales on the bodies of these
  rock-inhabiting species form pretty patterns, but are detached with such facility that it is
  almost impossible to obtain specimens in satisfactory condition for examination.</p>

  <p>In Machilidae the dorsal plates of the hind body are reflexed to the under surface so as to
  form an imbrication covering the sides of the ventral plates, and the eyes are largely developed;
  by which characters the family is distinguished from the Lepismidae. The pair of large compound
  eyes (Fig. 92, <i>O</i>) is a remarkable feature, being indeed unique in the Aptera. The
  structures (<i>o</i>, <i>o&prime;</i>) that Oudemans considers to be simple eyes have, in external
  appearance, a resemblance to the fenestrae of the <span class="pagenum" id="page185"><span
  class="smaller">{185}</span></span>Blattidae; Grassi states, however, that not only are they eyes,
  but that they are of almost unique structure, being, in fact, intermediate between simple and
  compound eyes.</p>

  <p>The mode of development of the compound eyes of <i>Machilis</i> is of considerable interest,
  but unfortunately very little is known about it, even the period at which the eyes appear being
  uncertain. Judging from analogy with the Orthoptera, we should suppose them to be present when the
  Insect leaves the egg, and Oudemans apparently considers this to be the case, but Bolivar states<a

  <p>The remaining family of Thysanura, the Lepismidae, is in certain respects the most highly
  developed of the Order. The covering of scales found on the body is very remarkable in some of the
  species, especially in the genus <i>Lepisma</i> (Fig. 93, <i>L. cincta</i>); the thoracic segments
  are different from one another <span class="pagenum" id="page186"><span
  class="smaller">{186}</span></span>and from those of the abdomen, and the tracheal system is more
  highly developed than it is in the Machilidae. Several genera are known, but only two members of
  the family have yet been detected in Britain. One of them (<i>Lepisma saccharina</i>), occurs only
  in houses, and is sometimes called the silver fish; it is, when full grown, less than half an inch
  long, and is covered with scales that give it a feebly metallic lustre. Like the other Thysanura,
  its movements are very perfect. It is said that it is occasionally injurious by nibbling paper,
  but the writer's observations lead him to doubt this; its usual food is doubtless farinaceous or
  saccharine matter. <i>Thermobia furnorum</i>, our other British Lepismid, has only recently been
  discovered; it is found in bakehouses at Cambridge and elsewhere. The bakers call these Insects
  fire-brats, apparently considering them to be fond of heat.</p>

  <p>Much valuable information as to the anatomy of Thysanura has been obtained by Grassi and
  Oudemans, and is of great interest. Taking four genera, viz. <i>Campodea</i>, <i>Japyx</i>,
  <i>Machilis</i>, and <i>Lepisma</i>, to represent the four families constituting the sub-order, we
  will briefly enumerate some of the more remarkable of the characters of their internal anatomy.
  <i>Campodea</i> has a very inferior development of the tracheal system; there are three pairs of
  spiracles, which are situate on the thoracic region; the tracheae connected with each spiracle
  remain distinct, not uniting with those coming from another spiracle; there are thus six separate
  small tracheal systems, three on each side of the body. <i>Japyx solifugus</i> has eleven pairs of
  spiracles, of which four are thoracic; the tracheae are united into one system on each side by
  means of lateral tubes; thus there are two extensive tracheal systems situate one on each side of
  the body, there being a single transverse tube, placed near the posterior extremity, uniting the
  two lateral systems. In <i>Machilis</i> there are nine pairs of stigmata, two of them thoracic,
  seven abdominal; the tracheae from each spiracle remain unconnected, so that there are eighteen
  separate tracheal systems, some of which are considerably more developed than others. The
  Lepismidae have ten pairs of stigmata, and the tracheae connected with them are completely united
  into one system by longitudinal and transverse tubes. Besides these differences there are others,
  of considerable importance, in the position of the stigmata.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page187"><span class="smaller">{187}</span></span></div>

  <p>All the Thysanura possess salivary glands. In <i>Campodea</i> there are about sixteen extremely
  short Malpighian tubules, or perhaps glands representing these organs; <i>Japyx</i> is destitute
  of these structures; <i>Machilis maritima</i> has twenty elongate tubules; in <i>Lepisma</i> also
  they are long, and apparently vary in number from four to eight in different species. The
  proportions of the three divisions of the alimentary canal differ extremely; there is a very large
  proventriculus in <i>Lepisma</i>, but not in the other families; coecal diverticula are present on
  the anterior part of the true stomach in <i>Machilis</i> and in <i>Lepisma</i>, but are wanting in
  <i>Campodea</i> and in <i>Japyx</i>.</p>

  <p>The dorsal vessel seems not to present any great differences in the sub-order. Grassi says
  there are no alary muscles present, but Oudemans describes them as existing in <i>Machilis</i>,
  but as being excessively delicate.</p>

  <p>The ventral chain of nerve-ganglia consists in <i>Campodea</i> of one cephalic ganglion, one
  sub-oesophageal (which clearly belongs to the ventral series of ganglia), three thoracic, and
  seven abdominal. In the other families there are eight instead of seven abdominal ganglia.</p>

  <p>The structure of the internal sexual organs is very remarkable in the Thysanura. In
  <i>Campodea</i> there is one extremely large, simple tube on each side of the body. In
  <i>Japyx</i> there are seven small tubes on each side, placed one in each of the successive
  abdominal segments, and opening into a common duct. In <i>Machilis</i> there are also seven tubes
  opening into a common duct, but the arrangement is no longer a distinctly segmental one. In
  <i>Lepisma</i> there are five egg-tubes on each side, the arrangement being segmental in the young
  state but not in the adult condition. In <i>Campodea</i> nutrient cells alternate with the eggs in
  the tubes, but this is not the case in the other families. Fig. 94 shows the ovaries in three of
  the Thysanura; in the drawing representing this part in <i>Machilis</i> (C), one of the two
  ovaries is cut away for the sake of clearness.</p>

  <p>The male organs in <i>Campodea</i> are very similar in size and arrangement to the ovaries,
  there being a single large tube or sac and a short vas deferens on each side of the body. In
  <i>Japyx</i> there is a sac on each side, but it is rendered double by a coecum at its base, and
  there are long and tortuous vasa deferentia. In <i>Lepisma</i> there are three pairs of coeca on
  each <span class="pagenum" id="page188"><span class="smaller">{188}</span></span>side, segmentally
  placed and opening into a common duct. In <i>Machilis</i> there are three retort-shaped sacs on
  each side opening near one another into a common duct, the vasa deferentia are elongate, and are
  very curiously formed, being each double for a considerable length, and the separated portions
  connected at intervals by five transverse commissural ducts.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>One of the characteristic features of Insect structure is the restriction of articulated legs
  to the thoracic region. In the Thysanura there exist appendages occupying a position on the hind
  body somewhat similar to that of the legs on the thorax. These appendages are quite small bodies,
  and are placed at the hind margins of the ventral plates of the abdomen, one near each side; they
  are connected by a simple joint to the sternite and are provided with muscles. They are found in
  <i>Campodea</i> on segments 2 to 7; in <i>Lepisma</i> on 8 and 9, in the allied <i>Nicoletia</i>
  on 2 to 9; in <i>Japyx</i> on 1 to 7, being, however, more rudimentary than they are in
  <i>Campodea</i>. In <i>Machilis</i> they attain perhaps their greatest development and exist on
  segments 2 to 9; moreover, in this genus such appendages occur also on the coxae of the second and
  third pairs of thoracic legs. Oudemans thinks they help to support the abdomen, and that they also
  assist in leaping; Grassi considers that they are supporting agents to some extent, but that they
  are essentially tactile organs. He calls them false legs "Pseudozampe."</p>

  <p>Still more remarkable and obscure in function are the vesicles found near the appendages; we
  figure a pair after Oudemans, showing them in the exserted state. In the retracted state the outer
  portion of the vesicles is withdrawn into the basal part <i>P</i> (Fig. 95), so that the vesicles
  are then only just visible, being <span class="pagenum" id="page189"><span
  class="smaller">{189}</span></span>concealed by the ventral plate. The abdominal appendage is not
  retractile. In <i>Machilis</i> there are twenty-two of these vesicles, arranged either two or four
  on one ventral plate of the hind body. They are also present in <i>Campodea</i>, where there are
  six pairs. They are usually said to be absent in <i>Japyx</i> and in <i>Lepisma</i>, but Haase
  shows<a id="NtA_119" href="#Nt_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a> that <i>Japyx</i> possess a pair placed
  behind the second ventral plate of the abdomen. The vesicles appear to be exserted by the entrance
  of blood into them, and to be retracted by muscular agency. Much difference of opinion prevails as
  to their function; it appears probable that they may be respiratory, as suggested by Oudemans.</p>

  <p>The scales found on the bodies of the Ectotrophous Thysanura may be looked on as modified
  hairs, and are essentially similar to those of the Lepidoptera, and they drop off as readily as do
  those of the Lepidoptera.</p>

  <p>Stummer-Traunfels, who has recently published<a id="NtA_120"
  href="#Nt_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> the results of his researches on the mouth-organs of Thysanura
  and Collembola, confirms the division of the Thysanura into Entotrophi and Ectotrophi, and
  considers that the Collembola agree with the former group. The German author therefore proposes to
  divide our Aptera, not into Thysanura and Collembola, but into Ectognathi and Entognathi, the
  former group consisting of Machilidae and Lepismidae, the latter of Campodeidae, Japygidae and the
  various families of Collembola. We think it far more natural, however, to retain the older
  division into Thysanura and Collembola.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Collembola.</b></p>

  <p>The sub-order Collembola, which we have defined on <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page182">182</a></span>, consists of small Insects, many of which possess the capacity of
  leaping, or springing suddenly, and when disturbed or alarmed naturally make use of this means of
  escaping. Their leaps, however, appear to be made quite at random, and very frequently do <span
  class="pagenum" id="page190"><span class="smaller">{190}</span></span>not have the result of
  taking the creature into concealment, and in such circumstances they may be rapidly and frequently
  repeated until the Insect feels itself, as we may suppose, in a position of safety. Three families
  may be very readily distinguished, viz. (1) Lipuridae, in which no leaping apparatus is present;
  (2) Poduridae, a leaping apparatus exists near the extremity of the abdomen; the body is
  subcylindric and evidently segmented; (3) Smynthuridae, a leaping apparatus exists: the body is
  sub-globular with comparatively large head and abdomen, the intervening thoracic region being
  small; the segmentation of the body is obscure.</p>

  <p>The study of the Collembola is much less advanced than that of the Thysanura, comparatively
  little having been added to our knowledge of the group since Lubbock's monograph of the British
  forms was published by the Ray Society in 1873. Why the Collembola should be neglected when the
  Thysanura attract so much attention is as inexplicable as many other fashions are.</p>

  <p>The family Lipuridae consists of a few very small and obscure Insects of soft consistence. They
  move slowly, and, owing to the absence of any leaping power, attract attention less readily than
  the other Collembola do. Two genera are generally recognised, and they should probably form
  separate families; indeed, in Lubbock's arrangement they do so. In one of the genera
  (<i>Anoura</i>) the mouth is very imperfect, no mandibles or maxillae having been detected, while
  in the other genus (<i>Lipura</i>) these organs exist.</p>

  <p>In the members of the family Poduridae, including the Degeeriidae of Lubbock, a saltatory
  apparatus is present in the form of appendages attached to the fifth abdominal segment
  (Degeeriides), or to the fourth (Podurides). These appendages are during life flexed beneath the
  body, but in dead specimens usually project backwards, having the appearance of a bifid tail.
  Poduridae are of elongate form, somewhat like small caterpillars, and are frequently prettily
  marked with variegate colours. Fig. 97 represents an arctic form closely allied to our native
  genus <i>Isotoma</i>.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page191"><span class="smaller">{191}</span></span></div>

  <p>The peculiar shape of the members of the Smynthuridae is sufficient for their identification.
  They possess a very convex abdomen, and very near to it a large head, the intervening chink being
  occupied by the small thorax. The segmentation of the body is not easily distinguished. Nicolet
  states that the thorax consists of three segments and the abdomen of the same number, and that
  when the Insect emerges from the egg these divisions can be perceived. In after life the posterior
  part of the thorax becomes amalgamated with the abdomen, so that it is difficult to trace the
  divisions, but there appears to be no information as to the manner in which this change occurs.
  Some of these minute Insects frequent trees and bushes, and their leaping powers are very perfect,
  so that it is difficult to capture them. The family includes both the Smynthuridae and the
  Papiriidae of Lubbock.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The two most characteristic organs of the Collembola are the spring and the ventral tube. The
  first of these is an elongate structure attached to the underside of the abdomen near its
  extremity, either on the penultimate or ante-penultimate segment. It consists of a basal part, and
  of two appendages attached thereto. It is carried under the Insect bent forwards, and is retained
  in this position by means of a catch which projects from the under surface of the third segment of
  the body, descending between the two branches of the spring, and passing under the extremity of
  its basal segment. It is considered that the spring is elastic, is flexed under the body by
  muscular action, and, being retained in this position <span class="pagenum" id="page192"><span
  class="smaller">{192}</span></span>of restraint by the catch, when the latter is removed the
  spring extends by reason of its elasticity, and the leap is thus executed. Whether this is really
  the exact method of leaping is, however, doubtful, for Lubbock says that the catch "only exists in
  certain genera"; while in its structure it does not appear to be well calculated to retain in
  position an organ that by virtue of its elasticity is constantly exerting a considerable
  force.</p>

      vesicle (<i>a</i>) protruded from ventral tube; <i>b</i>, the spring extended.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The ventral tube is an anomalous and enigmatic structure. In the lower forms, such as
  <i>Lipura</i> or <i>Anurida</i>, it consists merely of a papilla (Fig. 100, A, <i>a</i>) more or
  less divided by fissure into two parts. In the Smynthuridae it is more highly developed, and
  protects two long delicate tubes that are capable of being protruded, as shown in the outline
  profile of <i>Smynthurus fuscus</i> (Fig. 99), which is taken from specimens preserved in balsam
  by Mr. J. J. Lister. The nature and use of this ventral tube have given rise to much discussion.
  Lubbock considered, and others have agreed with him, that it serves to attach the Insect to bodies
  to which it may be desirable the Insect should, when in the perpendicular position, adhere.
  Reuter<a id="NtA_121" href="#Nt_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a> assigns a quite different function to
  this singular structure. He states that the hairs of the body are hygroscopic, and that the
  peculiar claws of the Insect having collected the moisture from the hairs, the ventral tube
  becomes the means of introducing the liquid into the body. These Insects possess, however, a
  mouth, and there seems to be no reason why a complex apparatus should be required in addition to
  it for so simple a purpose as the introduction of moisture to the interior of the body. Haase
  finds<a id="NtA_122" href="#Nt_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a> that Collembola can crawl on glass
  without the aid of the ventral tube; he considers its function to be physiological, and that it
  may probably be respiratory as it has been suggested is the case with the vesicles of Thysanura.
  The function of the ventral tube is certainly not yet satisfactorily elucidated. The vesicles
  contained in it are said to be extruded by blood-pressure, and withdrawn by muscular action in a
  manner similar to that which we have described as occurring <span class="pagenum"
  id="page193"><span class="smaller">{193}</span></span>in the case of the exsertile vesicles of the
  Thysanura. The processes in <i>Smynthurus</i> bear glandular structures at their extremities. It
  has been suggested that the ventral tube of Collembola is the homologue of a pair of ventral
  appendages. The term Collophore has been applied to it somewhat prematurely, seeing the doubt that
  still exists as to its function.</p>

  <p>Some of the Collembola possess a very curious structure called the prostemmatic or ante-ocular
  organ; its nature and function have been very inadequately investigated. The ocular organs of the
  Collembola consist, when they are present, of isolated ocelli placed at the sides of the head like
  the corresponding organs of caterpillars; the prostemmate is placed slightly in front of the group
  of ocelli, and has a concentric arrangement of its parts, reminding one somewhat of the compound
  eyes of the higher Insects. This structure is represented in Fig. 100, B, C; it is said by Sir
  John Lubbock to be present in some of the Lipuridae that have no ocelli, and he therefore prefers
  to speak of it as the "post-antennal" organ.</p>

  <p>A very characteristic feature in the Collembola is the slight development of the tracheal
  system. Although writers are far from being in accord as to details, it seems that stigmata and
  tracheae are usually absent. In <i>Smynthurus</i> there are, however, according to
  Lubbock,&mdash;whose statement is confirmed by Meinert and Tullberg,&mdash;a pair of stigmata
  situate on the head below the antennae, and from these there extends a tracheal system throughout
  the body. Such a position for stigmata is almost, if not quite unique in Insects; Grassi, however,
  seems to have found something of the kind existing in the embryo of the bee.</p>

  <p>At present only a small number of species of the Order Aptera are known; Lubbock recognised
  about sixty British species, and Finot sixty-five as found in France. The North American forms
  have not received so much attention as the European, and the Aptera of other countries, though
  they are probably everywhere fairly numerous, are scarcely known at all. A few have been described
  from the Indo-Malayan region and some from Chili, and the writer has seen species from the West
  Indian and Sandwich Islands. All the exotic forms as yet detected are very similar to those of
  Europe.</p>

  <p>The Thysanura are probably not very numerous in species, and appear to be in general intolerant
  of cold. With the Collembola <span class="pagenum" id="page194"><span
  class="smaller">{194}</span></span>the reverse is the case. They are excessively numerous in
  individuals; they are found nearly everywhere on the surface of the ground in climatic conditions
  like those of our country, while no less than sixteen species have been found in Nova Zembla and
  one each in Kerguelen and South Georgia. One species, if not more, of <i>Podura</i>, lives on the
  surface of stagnant waters, on which the minute creatures may frequently be seen leaping about in
  great numbers after being disturbed.</p>

  <p>In 1874 the plain of Gennevilliers in France was copiously irrigated; in the following year the
  soil was still very damp, and there existed numerous pools of stagnant water, on the surface of
  which <i>Podura aquatica</i> was developed in such prodigious quantity as to excite the
  astonishment of the inhabitants of the region.</p>

  <p>Accounts have been frequently given of the occurrence on snow and glaciers of Insects spoken of
  as snow-fleas, or snow-worms. These mostly relate to Poduridae, which are sometimes found in
  countless number in such situations. The reason for this is not well understood. According to F.
  L&ouml;w,<a id="NtA_123" href="#Nt_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> on the 17th of March at St. Jacob in
  Carinthia, Parson Kaiser observed, on the occurrence of the first thaw-weather, enormous numbers
  of a Podura (? <i>Achorutes murorum</i>) on the surface of the snow for an extent of about half a
  mile, the snow being rendered black in appearance by them; eleven days afterwards they were found
  in diminished numbers on the snow, but in large quantity on the water left by its melting. This
  account suggests that the occurrence of the Insects on the snow was merely an incident during
  their passage from the land, where they had been hibernating, to the surface of the water.</p>

  <p>One little member of the Lipuridae, <i>Anurida maritima</i> (<i>Lipura maritima</i> of
  Lubbock), has the habit, very unusual for an Insect, of frequenting salt water. It lives amongst
  the rocks on the shores of the English Channel, between high and low tide-marks. Its habits have
  been to some extent observed by Laboulb&egrave;ne<a id="NtA_124" href="#Nt_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a> and
  Moniez<a id="NtA_125" href="#Nt_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a>; it appears to be gregarious, and when
  the tide is high, to shelter itself against the commotions of the water in chinks of the rocks and
  other positions of advantage. When the tide is out the Insects apparently delight to <span
  class="pagenum" id="page195"><span class="smaller">{195}</span></span>congregate in masses on the
  surface of the rock pools. This <i>Anurida</i> can endure prolonged immersion; but both the
  observers we are quoting say that it is, when submerged, usually completely covered with a coat of
  air so that the water does not touch it. The little creature can, however, it would appear,
  subsist for some time in the pools of salt water, even when it is not surrounded by its customary
  protecting envelope of the more congenial element. Its food is said, on very slender evidence, to
  consist of the remains of small marine animals, such as Molluscs. We reproduce some of
  Laboulb&egrave;ne's figures (Fig. 100); the under-surface shows at a the divided papilla of the ventral
  tube; B, C represent the peculiar prostemmatic organ, alluded to on <span class="wnw">p. <a

  </div>

  <p>Very little information exists as to the life-history of the Aptera; as for their food, it is
  generally considered to consist of refuse vegetable or animal matter. It is usual to say that they
  are completely destitute of metamorphosis, but Templeton says of <i>Lepisma niveo-fasciata</i>
  that "the young differ so much from the mature Insect that I took them at first for a distinct
  species; the thoracic plates are proportionately less broad, and the first is devoid of the white
  marginal band." As regards the moults, it would appear that in this, as in so many other points,
  great diversity prevails, Grassi stating that in <i>Campodea</i> there is a single fragmentary
  casting of the skin; and Sommer informing us that in <i>Macrotoma plumbea</i> the moults are not
  only numerous, but continue, after the creature has attained its full growth, throughout life.</p>

  <p>A very marked feature of the Aptera is their intolerance of a dry atmosphere. Although
  <i>Campodea</i> can exist under very diverse conditions, it dies very soon after being placed in a
  dry closed tube; and the same susceptibility appears to be shared by all the other members of the
  Order, though it is not so extreme in all; possibly it may be due to some peculiarity in the
  structure <span class="pagenum" id="page196"><span class="smaller">{196}</span></span>of the
  integument. So far as tolerance of heat and cold goes, the Aptera can apparently exist in any
  climate, for though some of the species extend to the Arctic regions, others are peculiar to the
  tropics.</p>

  <p><i>Thysanura</i> are recorded by Klebs and Scudder as occurring commonly in amber; the latter
  author has described a fossil, supposed to be a <i>Lepisma</i>, found in the Tertiary deposits at
  Florissant. Scudder has also described another fossil, likewise from Florissant, which he
  considers to form a special sub-order of Thysanura&mdash;<i>Ballostoma</i>&mdash;but it is
  extremely doubtful whether this anomalous creature should be assigned to the Order at all. A still
  older fossil, <i>Dasyleptus lucasii</i> Brongniart, from the Carboniferous strata in France, is
  considered to belong to the Order Aptera, but it must be admitted there is some doubt on this
  point.</p>

  <p>The interest aroused in the minds of naturalists by the comparatively simple forms of these
  purely wingless and therefore anomalous Insects has been accompanied by much discussion as to
  their relations to other Insects, and as to whether they are really primitive forms, or whether
  they may perhaps be degenerate descendants from some less unusual states of Insect-life. Mayer and
  Brauer dissociated our Aptera entirely from other Insects, and proposed to consider the Hexapoda
  as being composed of two groups&mdash;(1) the Apterygogenea, consisting of the few species we have
  been specially considering; and (2) the Pterygogenea, including all the rest of the immense crowd
  of Insect forms. They were not, however, able to accompany their proposed division by any
  satisfactory characters of distinction, and the subsequent progress of knowledge has not supported
  their view, all the best investigators having found it necessary to recognise the extremely
  intimate relations of these Insects with the Orthoptera. Meinert thought that <i>Lepisma</i> must
  be included in the Orthoptera; Grassi proposes to consider the Thysanura as a distinct division of
  Orthoptera; and Oudemans recognises the close relations existing between <i>Machilis</i> and
  Orthoptera proper. Finot includes the Aptera in his Orthopt&egrave;res de la France, and a species of
  <i>Japyx</i> has actually been described by a competent entomologist as an apterous earwig. At
  present, therefore, we must conclude that no good distinction has been found to justify the
  separation of the Aptera from all other Insects.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page197"><span class="smaller">{197}</span></span></div>

  <p class="sp5">The taxonomy of the Collembola has not yet been adequately treated, and it is
  possible that more grounds will be found for separating them as a distinct Order from the
  Thysanura,&mdash;a course that was advocated by Lubbock,&mdash;than exist for dividing these
  latter from the Orthoptera proper. There are apparently no grounds for considering the Aptera to
  be degenerate Insects, and we may adopt the view of Grassi, that they are primitive, or rather
  little evolved forms. It must be admitted that there are not at present any sufficient reasons for
  considering these Insects to be "ancient" or "ancestral." The vague general resemblance of
  <i>Campodea</i> to many young Insects of very different kinds is clearly the correlative of its
  simple form, and is no more proof of actual ancestry to them than their resemblances <i>inter
  se</i> are proofs of ancestry to one another. But even if deprived of its claim to antiquity and
  to ancestral honours, it must be admitted that <i>Campodea</i> is an interesting creature. In its
  structure one of the most fragile of organisms, with a very feeble respiratory system, inadequate
  organs of sense, only one pair of ovarian tubes, very imperfect mouth-organs, and a simple
  alimentary canal, it nevertheless flourishes while highly-endowed Insects become extinct. In the
  suburban gardens of London, on the shores of the Mediterranean, on the summits of the higher
  Pyrenees, in North America even it is said in the caves of Kentucky, and in India, <i>Campodea</i>
  is at home, and will probably always be with us.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Order II.&mdash;Orthoptera.</b></p>

  <div class="fine sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Insects with the mouth parts conspicuous, formed for biting, the four palpi
    very distinct, the lower lip longitudinally divided in the middle. The tegmina (mesothoracic
    wings), of parchment-like consistence, in repose closed on the back of the Insect so as to
    protect it. The metathoracic wings, of more delicate consistence, ample, furnished with
    radiating or divergent nervures starting from the point of articulation, and with short cross
    nervules forming a sort of network; in repose collapsing like a fan, and more or less completely
    covered by the tegmina (except in certain Phasmidae, where, though the wings are ample, the
    tegmina are minute, so that the wings are uncovered). In a few forms (winged Forficulidae and
    some Blattidae) the metathoracic wings are, in addition to the longitudinal folding, contracted
    by means of one or two transverse folds. The mode of growth of each individual is a gradual
    increase of size, without any abrupt change of form, except that the wings are only fully
    developed in the final condition. There is no special pupal instar. Species in which the wings
    are absent or rudimentary are numerous.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>The Orthoptera are Insects of comparatively large size. The Order, indeed, includes the largest
  of existing Insects, while none are so minute as many of the members of the other Orders are;
  three millimetres is the least length known for an Orthopterous Insect, and there are very few so
  small, though this is ten times the length of the smallest beetle. The Order includes earwigs,
  cockroaches, soothsayers or praying-insects, stick- and leaf-insects, grasshoppers, locusts, green
  grasshoppers, and crickets.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page199"><span class="smaller">{199}</span></span></div>

  <p>The changes of form that accompany the growth of the individual are much less abrupt and
  conspicuous than they are in most other Insects. The metamorphosis is therefore called
  Paurometabolous. It has been supposed by some naturalists that Orthoptera go through a larger
  portion of their development in the egg than other Insects do. This does not clearly appear to be
  the case, though it seems that there are distinctions of a general character in the embryology;
  the period of development in the egg is prolonged, and the yolk is said by Wheeler<a id="NtA_126"
  href="#Nt_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> to be more than usually abundant in comparison with the size
  of the young embryo. The embryonic development may in tropical countries be accomplished in three
  weeks (see Mantidae), but in countries where winter supervenes, the period may in some species be
  extended over seven or eight months.</p>

  <p>The external features of the post-embryonic development&mdash;a term that is more convenient in
  connexion with Orthoptera than metamorphosis&mdash;are as follows: the wings are never present
  when the Insect is first hatched, but appear subsequently, and increase in size at the moults; the
  form and proportions of the segments of the body&mdash;especially of the thorax&mdash;undergo much
  change; an alteration of colour occurs at some of the moults, and the integument becomes harder in
  the adult condition. Neither the development of the internal organs, nor the physiological
  processes by which the changes of external form are effected, appear to have been studied to any
  great extent.</p>

  <p>Many of the Orthoptera do not possess wings fit for flight, and some species even in the adult
  state have no trace whatever of such organs. Flight, indeed, appears to be of minor importance in
  the Order; in many cases where the wings exist they are purely musical organs, and are not of any
  use for flight. The apterous and the flightless conditions are not confined to one division of the
  Order, but are found in all the families and in many of their subdivisions. As the front pair of
  wings in Orthoptera do not really carry out the function of flight, and as they differ in several
  particulars from the hinder pair, or true wings, it is usual to call them tegmina. The musical
  powers of the Orthoptera are confined to the saltatorial group of families.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The Cursoria are dumb or nearly so; it is a remarkable fact that also in this latter division
  the alar organs, though frequently present, have but little value for flight, and are in some
  cases devoted to what we may call purposes of ornament or concealment. This is specially the case
  in the Phasmidae and Mantidae, where the effectiveness of colour and pattern of these parts
  becomes truly astonishing. The tegmina frequently exhibit an extraordinary resemblance to
  vegetable structures, and this appearance is not superficial, for it may be seen that the nervures
  of the wings in their disposition and appearance resemble almost exactly the ribs of leaves. One
  of the most remarkable of the features of Orthoptera is that a great difference frequently exists
  between the colours of the tegmina and of the wings, <i>i.e.</i> the front and hind wings; the
  latter are concealed in the condition of repose, but when activity is entered on and they are
  displayed, the individual becomes in appearance a totally different creature. In some cases,
  contrary to what usually occurs in Insects, it is the female that is most remarkable; the male in
  Mantidae and Phasmidae being frequently a creature of quite inferior appearance and power in
  comparison with his consort. The musical powers of the saltatorial Orthoptera are, however,
  specially characteristic of the male sex. There is evidence that these powers are of great
  importance to the creatures, though in what way is far from clear. Some parts of the structures of
  the body are in many of these musical species clearly dominated by the musical organs, and are
  apparently specially directed to securing their efficiency. We find in some Locustidae that the
  tegmina are nothing but sound-producing instruments, while the pronotum is prolonged to form a
  hood that protects them without encumbering their action. In the males of the Pneumorides, where
  the phonetic organ is situated on the abdomen, this part of the body is inflated and tense, no
  doubt with the result of increasing the volume and quality of the sound. In the genus
  <i>Methone</i> (Fig. 185) we find a grasshopper whose great hind legs have no saltatorial
  function, and but little power of locomotion, but act as parts of a sound-producing <span
  class="pagenum" id="page201"><span class="smaller">{201}</span></span>instrument, and as agents
  for protecting some parts of the body in repose. Further particulars of these cases must be looked
  for in our accounts of the different groups.</p>

  <p>The eggs of many Orthoptera are deposited in capsules or cases; these capsules may contain only
  one egg, or a great many.</p>

  <p>The Order includes many species of Insects, though in Britain it is poorly represented: we have
  only about forty species, and this small number includes some that are naturalised. Only a few of
  the forty extend their range to Scotland. A revision of the species found in Britain has recently
  been made by Mr. Eland Shaw.<a id="NtA_127" href="#Nt_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> In continental
  Europe, especially in the south, the species become more numerous; about 500 are known as
  inhabitants of geographical Europe. In countries where the face of nature has been less
  transformed by the operations of man, and especially in the tropical parts of the world,
  Orthoptera are much more abundant.</p>

  <p>The lowest number at which the species now existing on the surface of the earth can be
  estimated is 10,000. This, however, is probably far under the mark, for the smaller and more
  obscure species of Orthoptera have never been thoroughly collected in any tropical continental
  region, while new forms of even the largest size are still frequently discovered in the
  tropics.</p>

  <p>The first five of these subdivisions are amongst the most distinct of any that exist in the
  Insecta, there being no connecting links between them.  The three groups forming the <span

  <p class="sp3">Owing partly to the inherent difficulties of the subject, and partly to the
  fragmentary manner in which it has been treated by systematists, it has been impossible till
  recently to form any clear idea of the classification of Orthoptera. During the last twenty years
  Henri de Saussure and Brunner von Wattenwyl have greatly elucidated this subject. The latter of
  these two distinguished naturalists has recently published<a id="NtA_128"

  assistance to those who may wish to study these Insects. We therefore reproduce from it the
  characters of the tribes, placing the portion relating to each family at the end of our sketch

  <p>Although earwigs are said to be rare in most parts of the world, yet in Europe no Insect is
  better known than <i>Forficula auricularia</i>, the common earwig, it being very abundant even in
  gardens and cultivated places.  In certain seasons it not unfrequently enters our houses, in which
  case it too often falls a <span class="pagenum" id="page203"><span
  class="smaller">{203}</span></span>victim to prejudices that have very little to justify them.
  This Insect is a good type of the winged earwigs. In the parts of the mouth it exhibits the
  structures usual in the Orthoptera; there is a large labrum, a pair of maxillae, each provided
  with two lobes and a palpus consisting of two very short basal joints and three longer joints
  beyond these; the mandibles are strong, with curvate pointed extremities; in the lower lip there
  is a ligula exposed in front of a very large mentum; it consists of two pieces, not joined
  together along the middle, but each bearing on its lateral edge a palpus with two elongate joints
  and a short basal one; this lip is completed by the lingua, which reposes on the upper face of the
  part, and completely overlaps and protects the chink left by the want of union along the middle
  line of the external parts of the lip. The antennae are elongate, filiform, and are borne very
  near the front of the exserted head. There are rather large facetted eyes, but no ocelli. The
  three segments of the thorax are distinct, the prothorax being quite free and capable of movement
  independent of the parts behind it: the meso- and meta-nota are covered by the tegmina and wings;
  these latter project slightly from underneath the former in the shape of small slips, that are
  often of rather lighter colour; the wing-covers are short, not extending beyond the insertion of
  the hind legs, and repose flat on the back, meeting together in a straight line along the middle.
  These peculiar flat, abbreviated wing-covers, with small slips (which are portions of the folded
  wings) projecting a little from underneath them, are distinctive marks of the winged
  Forficulidae.</p>

  <p>The legs are inserted far from one another, the coxae being small; each sternum of the three
  thoracic segments projects backwards, forming a peculiar long, free fold, underlapping the front
  part of the following segment. The hind body or abdomen is elongate, and is formed of ten
  segments; the number readily visible being two less in the female than it is in the male. The
  segments are fitted together by a complex imbrication, which admits of great mobility and
  distension, while offering a remarkable power of resistance to external pressure: each segment is
  inserted far forward in the interior of that preceding it, and each also consists of separate
  upper and lower plates that much overlap where they meet at the sides (see Fig. 103). The body is
  always terminated by a pair of horny, pincer-like <span class="pagenum" id="page204"><span
  class="smaller">{204}</span></span>processes, which are differently shaped according to the sex of
  the individual.</p>

      9th dorsal plates (7 and 8 in Fig.).</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The structure of the abdomen in the earwig has given rise to considerable discussion.  In Fig.
  103 we reproduce Westwood's diagram of it as seen fully distended in a female specimen; in this
  state the minute spiracles can be detected, though in the normal condition of the body they cannot
  be seen, being placed on the delicate membranes that connect the chitinous plates. Westwood's
  interpretation of the structure was not, however, quite correct, as the part which he considered
  to be the first dorsal plate is really the second; so that the segments numbered 7, 8, 9 in our
  figure are really 8, 9, 10. The common earwig is interesting as exhibiting, in an imperfect state,
  the union of the first dorsal plate of the abdomen with the thorax; a condition which is carried
  to so great an extent in the Hymenoptera as to quite obscure the nature of the parts, and which
  has consequently given rise to much perplexity and discussion. We represent this structure as seen
  in the common earwig in Fig. 104, where <i>a</i> represents the pronotum, <i>b</i> the mesonotum,
  <i>c</i> the metanotum, <i>d</i> the first, <i>f</i> the second abdominal segment; <i>e</i> being
  a delicate membrane of considerable size that intervenes between the two, and which is more
  exposed than are the corresponding membranes connecting the subsequent rings; a condition similar
  to that which is found in <i>Cimbex</i>, <i>Cephus</i>, and some other Hymenoptera.</p>

  <p>On the under surface of the abdomen of the earwig the full number of 10 plates cannot be
  superficially distinguished; but it is found by dissection that in the female the short eighth and
  ninth dorsal rings are joined on the ventral aspect by a delicate membrane, while the tenth
  ventral is of a less delicate <span class="pagenum" id="page205"><span
  class="smaller">{205}</span></span>nature, and forms a triangular plate at the base of each half
  of the forceps. Between the branches of the forceps there is a perpendicular plate, the pygidium
  of Orthopterists, possibly the unpaired terminal portion of the body seen in some embryos, and
  called the telson. The pygidium is a separate sclerite, though it looks as if it were only a
  portion of the large tenth dorsal plate bent downwards, and in some descriptive works is
  erroneously described as being such.</p>

  <p>A very large number of species of Forficulidae have the organs of flight undeveloped. Fig. 105
  represents <i>Chelidura dilatata</i>, an apterous form that is very common in the Eastern
  Pyrenees. The condition of the meso- and meta-nota&mdash;the parts from which the tegmina and
  wings are developed, and to which they are attached when present&mdash;is very remarkable in these
  forms, and exhibits much variety. In Fig. 106 we represent the conditions of these parts in a few
  apterous forms. The tegmina or the segment from which they are developed (<i>b</i>), are seen in
  the shape of a plate which may extend all across the middle and be undivided (No. 4); in which
  case the appearance indicates entire absence of the tegmina; these are, on the contrary, evidently
  present in the form of slips grafted one to each side of the second thoracic segment in
  <i>Anisolabis</i> (No. 3); or they may look like short broad slips extending all across the body,
  and marking off a piece frequently called a scutellum, but which is really the mesonotum (some
  species of <i>Chelidura</i>, as No. 2); or, again, they may be nearly free tegmina, somewhat
  similar to those of the winged forms; this is the case with some species of <i>Chelidura</i>, as
  represented by No. 1. This last figure is taken from a species from the Sierra Nevada, apparently
  undescribed, allied to <i>C. bolivari</i>.</p>

  <p>In the cases we are considering no analogous structures exist on <span class="pagenum"
  id="page206"><span class="smaller">{206}</span></span>the metanotum (the part of the body that in
  the winged forms bears the wings, and which is marked <i>c</i> in our diagrams, Fig. 106), so that
  the tegmina are to all appearance less rudimentary (or vestigial) than the wings. The metanotum
  forms a sort of flap, called by Fischer<a id="NtA_129" href="#Nt_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a>
  "involucrum alarum"; he considered the part immediately behind this to be the metanotum; this
  piece is, however, no doubt really part of the abdomen (<i>d</i> in our Figure). This is
  apparently the view taken by Brunner.<a id="NtA_130" href="#Nt_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> The
  structure of these parts is important as bearing on the subject of the nature and origin of
  Insects' wings, a question to which no satisfactory answer has yet been given. The appearances we
  have remarked on are to some extent similar to the conditions existing in the immature state of
  the organs of flight in the common earwig (see Fig. 112, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page212">212</a></span>), but whether the varieties presented by the wingless forms have
  parallels in the immature conditions of the various winged forms is quite uncertain, the
  life-histories of earwigs being almost unknown.</p>

  <p>The developed wings of earwigs are worthy of attention, both as regards their actual structure
  and the manner in which they are folded up in repose. When expanded they have a shape curiously
  suggestive of the human ear. The chief parts of the wing, as shown in Fig. 107, A, are <i>a</i>,
  <i>b</i>, two portions of the horny piece that forms the scale which covers the more delicate
  parts of the wing when it is folded, and which, according to Brunner, represents the radial and
  ulnar fields of the wings of Acridiidae and Locustidae (see Fig. 167); <i>c</i> is the small
  apical field limited below by the vena dividens; <i>d</i> is the vena plicata which runs along the
  under side of the scale as far as the apical field, where it gives off the axillary nerves;
  <i>e</i> is a vena spuria, or adventitious vein such as exists in many other Orthoptera with
  delicate wings. On the front part of the scale, <i>a</i>, and on a different plane so that it is
  not shown in our figure, there is a very delicate small band which is supposed to <span
  class="pagenum" id="page207"><span class="smaller">{207}</span></span>represent the marginal field
  of the wing of other Orthoptera. There are, however, grave difficulties in the way of accepting
  this view of the earwig's wing, amongst which we may mention the position of the vena dividens and
  its relation to the so-called radial and ulnar fields of the wing. The wings are remarkable for
  their delicacy; moreover, the way in which they fold up so as to be packed in the manner shown in
  B, Fig. 107, is very interesting, there being, in fact, no other Insects that fold up their wings
  in so complicated and compact a fashion as the earwigs do. The process is carried out somewhat as
  follows: the longer radii come a little nearer together, the delicate membrane between them
  falling into folds somewhat like those of a paper fan; a transverse fold, or turn-over, then
  occurs at the point where the radii, or axillary nerves, start from the vena plicata; then a
  second transverse fold, but in a reversed direction, occurs affecting the wing just close to the
  spots where the shorter radial nervures are dilated; then by a contraction close to the scale the
  whole series of complex folds and double are brought together and compressed.</p>

  <p>It is quite a mystery why earwigs should fold their wings in this complex manner, and it is
  still more remarkable that the Insects very rarely use them. Indeed, though <i>Forficula
  auricularia</i> is scarcely surpassed in numbers by any British Insect, yet it is rarely seen on
  the wing; it is probable that the majority of the individuals of this species may never make use
  of their organs of flight or go through the complex process of unfolding and folding them. It
  should be remarked that no part of the delicate membranous expanse of the wing is exposed when the
  wings are packed in their position of repose; for the portion that projects from under the
  tegmina&mdash;and which, it will be remembered, is always present, for when wings exist in earwigs
  they are never entirely concealed by the tegmina&mdash;is, it is curious to note, of hard texture,
  and is frequently coloured and sculptured in harmony with the tegmen; in fact, one small part of
  the wing forms in colour and texture a most striking contrast to the rest of the organ, but agrees
  in these respects with the wing-covers. This condition is seen in Fig. 108, where B shows the
  sculpture of the tegmina <i>t</i>, and of the projecting tips of the wings <i>w</i>. There are
  numerous other instances in Orthoptera where one part of a wing or wing-case <span class="pagenum"
  id="page208"><span class="smaller">{208}</span></span>is exposed and the other part concealed, and
  the exposed portion is totally different in colour and texture from the concealed portion.</p>

  <p>The wings of earwigs are attached to the body in a very unusual manner; each wing is continued
  inwards on the upper surface of the metanotum, as if it were a layer of the integument meeting its
  fellow on the mesial line; the point of contact forming two angles just behind the metanotum.</p>

  <p>Some writers have considered that the tegmina of earwigs are not the homologues of those of
  other Orthoptera, but are really tegulae (cf. Fig. 56, <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page103">103</a></span>). We are not aware that any direct evidence has been produced in
  support of this view.</p>

  <p>The pair of forceps with which the body is armed at its extremity forms another character
  almost peculiar to the earwigs, but which exists in the genus <i>Japyx</i> of the Thysanura. These
  forceps vary much in the different genera of the family; they sometimes attain a large size and
  assume very extraordinary and distorted shapes. They are occasionally used by the Insects as a
  means of completing the process of packing up the wings, but in many species it is not probable
  that they can be used for this purpose, because their great size and peculiarly distorted forms
  render them unsuitable for assisting in a delicate process of arrangement; they are, too, always
  present in the wingless forms of the family. Their importance to the creature is at present quite
  obscure; we can only compare them with the horns of Lamellicorn Coleoptera, which have hitherto
  proved inexplicable so far as utility is concerned. No doubt the callipers of the earwigs give
  them an imposing appearance, and may be of some little advantage on this account; they are not
  known to be used as offensive instruments for fighting, but they are occasionally brought into
  play for purposes of defence, the creatures using them for the infliction of nips, which, however,
  are by no means of a formidable character.</p>

  <p>These forceps are, in the case of the common earwig&mdash;and they have not been studied from
  this point of view in any other species&mdash;remarkable, because of the great variation in their
  development in the male, a character which again reminds us of the horns of Lamellicorn beetles:
  in the female they are comparatively invariable, as is also the case in the few species of
  Lamellicornia, which possess horned females. A and B in Figure 109 represent the forceps of
  different males of the common earwig, C showing those of the other sex. The subject of the
  variation of the male callipers of the earwig has been considered by Messrs. Bateson and
  Brindley,<a id="NtA_131" href="#Nt_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a> who examined 1000 specimens captured
  on the same day on one of the Farne islands off the coast of Northumberland; 583 of these were
  mature males, and the pincers were found to vary in length from about 2&frac12; mm. to 9 mm. (A and B in
  Fig. 109 represent two of the more extreme forms of this set of individuals.) Specimens of medium
  size were not, as it might perhaps have been expected they would be, the most common; there were,
  in fact, only about 12 individuals having the forceps of the medium length&mdash;4&frac34; to 5&frac14; mm.,
  while there were no less than 90 individuals having forceps of a length of about 7 mm., and 120
  with a length of from 2&frac34; to 3&frac14;. Males with a medium large length of the organ and with a medium
  small length thereof were the most abundant, so that a sort of dimorphism was found to exist.
  Similar relations were detected in the length of the horns of the male of a Lamellicorn beetle
  examined by these gentlemen. In the case of the set of earwigs we have mentioned, very little
  variation existed in the length of the forceps in the female sex.</p>

  <p>In many earwigs&mdash;including <i>F. auricularia</i>&mdash;there may be seen on each side of
  the dorsal aspect of the true fourth, or of the fourth and neighbouring segments of the hind body
  a small elevation, called by systematists a plica or fold, and on examination the fold will be
  found to possess a small orifice on its posterior aspect. These folds are shown in Figs. 105 and
  108; <span class="pagenum" id="page210"><span class="smaller">{210}</span></span>they have been
  made use of for purposes of classification, though no functional importance was attached to them.
  Meinert, however, discovered<a id="NtA_132" href="#Nt_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> that there are
  foetid glands in this situation, and Vosseler has recently shown<a id="NtA_133"
  href="#Nt_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a> that the folds are connected with scent-glands, from which
  proceed, in all probability, the peculiar odour that is sometimes given off by the earwig. The
  forms destitute of the folds, e.g. <i>Labidura</i>, are considered to have no scent glands. There
  is a very peculiar series of smooth marks in the earwigs on the dorsal aspect of the abdominal
  segments, and these are present in the glandless forms as well as in the others.</p>

  <p>The internal anatomy has been to some extent investigated by Dufour and Meinert. Dufour
  dissected <i>F. auricularia</i> and <i>Labidura riparia</i>, and found<a id="NtA_134"
  href="#Nt_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> that salivary glands exist in the latter Insect (called by him
  <i>Forficula gigantea</i>), though he was unable to discover them in the common earwig. According
  to Meinert,<a id="NtA_135" href="#Nt_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> there are, however, salivary glands
  affixed to the stipes of the maxillae in <i>F. auricularia</i>, while (in addition?) <i>L.
  riparia</i> possesses very elongate glands seated in the middle or posterior part of the breast.
  The alimentary canal is destitute of convolutions, but oesophagus, crop, and gizzard all exist,
  and the intestine behind the stomach consists of three divisions. The Malpighian tubes are
  numerous, 30 or 40, and elongate. The respiratory system is not highly developed.
  Earwigs&mdash;the European species at least&mdash;have, as already mentioned, very small powers of
  flight; the tracheal system is correspondingly small, and is destitute of the vesicular
  dilatations that are so remarkable in the migratory Locusts.</p>

  <p>The three thoracic spiracles<a id="NtA_136" href="#Nt_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> are readily
  observed in living <span class="pagenum" id="page211"><span
  class="smaller">{211}</span></span>individuals. There are seven pairs of abdominal spiracles,
  which, however, are very minute, and can only be found by distending the body as shown in Fig.
  103. The ventral chain consists of nine ganglia (the sub-oesophageal centre is not alluded to by
  Dufour); the three thoracic are equidistant and rather small; the hindmost of the six abdominal
  ganglia is considerably larger than any one of the other five.</p>

  <p>The ovaries of <i>Labidura riparia</i> and <i>Forficula auricularia</i> are extremely
  different. In <i>L. riparia</i> there are on each side five tubes, each terminating separately in
  an obliquely directed lateral part of the oviduct. In <i>F. auricularia</i> there is but one tube
  on each side, but it is covered by three longitudinal series of very short sub-sessile, grape-like
  bodies, each of the two tubes being much dilated behind the point where these bodies cease.</p>

  <p>The testes in earwigs are peculiar and simple; they consist, on each side, of a pair of curvate
  tubular bodies, connected at their bases and prolonged outwards in the form of an elongate,
  slender vas deferens. The structures in the males of several species have been described at some
  length by Meinert,<a id="NtA_137" href="#Nt_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a> who finds that in some
  species a double ejaculatory duct exists.</p>

  <p>The young is similar to the adult in form; in the winged forms it is always easy to distinguish
  the adult by the full development of the wings, but in the wingless forms it can only be decided
  with certainty that a specimen is not adult by the softer and weaker condition of the integuments.
  Scarcely anything appears to be known as to the life-history, except a few observations that have
  been made on the common earwig; Camerano found<a id="NtA_138" href="#Nt_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a>
  that this Insect has certainly three ecdyses, and possibly <span class="pagenum"
  id="page212"><span class="smaller">{212}</span></span>an earlier one which he failed to notice,
  and his observation confirms the vague previous statement of Fischer. The eggs, in the
  neighbourhood of Turin, are deposited and hatched in the early spring; in one case they were laid
  on the 10th March, and the Insects issuing from them had completed their growth and were
  transformed into perfect Insects on the 22nd May. In the immature state the alar structures of the
  future imago may be detected. The tegmina-bearing sclerites, <i>t</i>, Fig. 112, look then
  somewhat like those of some of the apterous forms (Fig. 106) and, as shown in A and B, Fig. 112,
  do not differ greatly in the earlier and later stages. The wings, however, change much more than
  the tegmina do; at first (Fig. 112, A) there is but little difference between the two, though in
  the interior of the wing-flap some traces of a radiate arrangement can be seen, as shown at
  <i>W</i> in A, Fig. 112; in a subsequent condition the wing-pads are increased in size and are
  more divided, the appearance indicating that the wings themselves are present and packed about a
  centre, as shown in <i>W</i> of B, Fig. 112.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the young of the common earwig the number of joints<a id="NtA_139"
  href="#Nt_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> in the antennae increases with age. Camerano, <i>l.c.</i>,
  says that before emergence from the egg there are apparently only 8 joints in the antennae, and
  Fischer states that the larvae of <i>F. auricularia</i> have at first only 8 antennal joints;
  later on 12 joints are commonly found, and, according to Bateson,<a id="NtA_140"
  href="#Nt_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a> this number occasionally persists even in the adult
  individual. Meinert says<a id="NtA_141" href="#Nt_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a> that the newly hatched
  <i>Forficula</i> has either 6 or 8 joints, and he adds that in the later portion of the
  preparatory stage the number is 12. Considerable discrepancy prevails in books as to the normal
  number of joints in the antennae of the adult <i>F. auricularia</i>, the statements varying from
  13 to 15. The latter number may be set aside as erroneous, although it is, curiously <span
  class="pagenum" id="page213"><span class="smaller">{213}</span></span>enough, the one given in the
  standard works of Fischer, Brunner, and Finot. Meinert gives without hesitation 14 as the number;
  Bateson, <i>l.c.</i>, found that 14 joints occurred in 70 or 80 per cent of adult individuals,
  that 13 was not uncommon, that 12 or 11 occasionally occurred, and that the number may differ in
  the two antennae of the same individual. These variations, which seem at first sight very
  remarkable, may with probability be considered as due to the fact that in the young state the
  number of joints increases with age, and that the organs are so fragile that one or more of the
  joints is very frequently then lost, the loss being more or less completely repaired during the
  subsequent development. Thus a disturbing agency exists, so that the normal number of 14 joints is
  often departed from, though it appears to be really natural for this species. Bateson has also
  pointed out that when the normal number of articulations is not present, the relative proportions
  of joints 3 and 4 are much disturbed. It is, however, probable that the increase in number of the
  joints takes place by division of the third or third and fourth joints following previous growth
  thereof, as in Termitidae; so that the variations, as was suggested by Bateson, may be due to
  mutilation of the antennae, and consequent incompletion of the normal form of the parts from which
  the renovation takes place; growth preceding segmentation&mdash;in some cases the growth may be
  like that of the adult, while the segmentation remains more incomplete. In the young the forceps
  of the two sexes differ but slightly; the form of the abdominal rings is, on the contrary,
  according to Fischer, already different in the two sexes in the early stage.</p>

  <p>The common earwig has a very bad reputation with gardeners, who consider it to be an injurious
  Insect, but it is probable that the little creature is sometimes made the scapegoat for damage
  done by other animals; it appears to be fond of sweets, for it often makes its way to the interior
  of fruits, and it no doubt nibbles the petals, or other delicate parts of flowers and vegetables.
  Camerano, however, states, <i>l.c.</i>, that the specimens he kept in confinement preferred dead
  Insects rather than the fruits he offered them. R&uuml;hl considers the earwig to be fond of a
  carnivorous diet, eating larvae, small snails, etc., and only attacking flowers when these fail.<a
  id="NtA_142" href="#Nt_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a> It has a great propensity for concealing <span
  class="pagenum" id="page214"><span class="smaller">{214}</span></span>itself in places where there
  is only a small crevice for entry, and it is possible that its presence in fruits is due to this,
  rather than to any special fondness for the sweets. This habit of concealing itself in chinks and
  crannies in obscure places makes it an easy matter to trap the Insect by placing pieces of hollow
  stalks in the situations it affects; inverted flower-pots with a little hay, straw, or paper at
  the top are also effectual traps. We have remarked that it is very rarely seen on the wing, and
  though it has been supposed to fly more freely at night there is very little evidence of the fact.
  Another British species, <i>Labia minor</i>, a smaller Insect, is, however, very commonly seen
  flying.</p>

  <p>Earwigs have the reputation of being fond of their young, and Camerano describes the female of
  the common earwig as carefully collecting its eggs when scattered, lifting them with its mandibles
  and placing them in a heap over which it afterwards brooded. De Geer<a id="NtA_143"
  href="#Nt_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> more than a century ago observed a fondness of the mother for
  the young. After the eggs were hatched, Camerano's individual, however, evinced no interest in the
  young. A larger species, <i>Labidura riparia</i> (Fig. 110) is said to move its eggs from place to
  place, so as to keep them in situations favourable for their development.</p>

  <p>The name "earwig" is said to be due to an idea that these creatures are fond of penetrating
  into the ears of persons when asleep. Hence these Insects were formerly much dreaded, owing to a
  fear that they might penetrate even to the brain. There does not appear to be on record any
  occurrence that could justify such a dread, or the belief that they enter the ears. If they do not
  do so, it is certainly a curious fact that a superstition of the kind we have mentioned occurs in
  almost every country where the common earwig is abundant; for it has, in most parts of Europe, a
  popular name indicating the prevalence of some such idea. It is known as <i>Ohren-wurm</i> in
  German, as <i>perce-oreille</i> in French, and so on. The expanded wing of the earwig is in shape
  so very like the human ear, that one is tempted to suppose this resemblance may in former ages
  have given rise to the notion that the earwig has some connexion with the human ear; but this
  explanation is rendered very improbable by the fact that the earwig is scarcely ever seen with its
  wings expanded, and that it is a most difficult matter to unfold them <span class="pagenum"
  id="page215"><span class="smaller">{215}</span></span>artificially, so that it is very unlikely
  that the shape of the wings should have been observed by untutored peoples.</p>

  <p>The group Forficulidae seems to be most rich in species in warm and tropical regions; several
  unwinged species are met with in the mountainous districts of Europe; indeed, in some spots their
  individuals are extremely numerous under stones. In Britain we have a list of six species, but
  only two of these are to be met with; the others have probably been introduced by the agency of
  man, and it is doubtful whether more than one of these immigrants is actually naturalised here.
  One of these doubtfully native species is the fine <i>Labidura riparia</i> (Fig. 110), which was
  formerly found near Bournemouth. Altogether about 400 species of earwigs are known at the present
  time, and as they are usually much neglected by Insect collectors, it is certain that this number
  will be very largely increased, so that it would be a moderate estimate to put the number of
  existing species at about 2000 or 3000. None of them attain a very large size, <i>Psalis
  americana</i> being one of the largest and most robust of the family; a few display brilliant
  colours, and some exhibit a colour ornamentation of the surface; there are two or three species
  known that display a general resemblance to Insects of other Orders. The remarkable earwig
  represented in Fig. 102 (and which appears to be a nondescript form&mdash;either species or
  variety&mdash;closely allied to <i>P. marmoricauda</i>) was found by Baron von H&uuml;gel on the
  mountains of Java; the femora in this Insect have a broad face which is turned upwards instead of
  outwards, the legs taking a peculiar position; and it is curious that this exposed surface is
  ornamented with a pattern. The feature that most attracts attention on inspecting a collection of
  earwigs is, however, the forceps, and this is the most marked collective character of the group.
  These curious organs exhibit a very great variety; in some cases they are as long as the whole of
  the rest of the body, in others they are provided with tynes; sometimes they are quite
  asymmetrical, as in <i>Anisolabis tasmanica</i> (Fig. 113); in <i>Opisthocosmia cervipyga</i>, and
  many others they are curiously distorted in a variety of ways. The classification of the earwigs
  is still in a rudimentary state; the number of joints in the antennae, the form of the feet, and
  (in the terrestrial forms) the shape of the rudimentary wing-cases and wings being the characters
  that have been made most use of by <span class="pagenum" id="page216"><span
  class="smaller">{216}</span></span>systematists; no arrangement into sub-families or groups of
  greater importance than genera is adopted.</p>

  <p>The only particulars we have as to the embryological development of the earwig are due to
  Heymons.<a id="NtA_144" href="#Nt_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a> The forceps spring from the eleventh
  abdominal segment, and represent the cerci of other Orthoptera. An egg-tooth is found to be
  present on the head for piercing the egg-shell. The embryo reverses its curved position during the
  development, as other Orthoptera have been observed to do, but in a somewhat different manner,
  analogous to that of the Myriapods.</p>

  <p>Several fossil Forficulidae are known; specimens belonging to a peculiar genus have been
  described from the Lower Lias of Aargau and from the Jurassic strata in Eastern Siberia, but the
  examples apparently are not in a very satisfactory state of preservation. In the Tertiary
  formations earwigs have been found more frequently. Scudder has described eleven species of one
  peculiar genus from the Lower Miocene beds at Florissant in Colorado; some of these specimens have
  been found with the wings expanded, and no doubt that they were fully developed Forficulidae can
  exist. The fossil species of earwigs as yet known do not display so remarkable a development of
  the forceps as existing forms do.</p>

  <p>Brauer and others treat the Forficulidae as a separate Order of
  Insects&mdash;Dermaptera&mdash;but the only structural characters that can be pointed out as
  special to the group are the peculiar form of the tegmina and hind wings&mdash;which latter, as we
  have said on <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page206">206</a></span>, are considered by some to be
  formed on essentially the same plan as those of other Orthoptera&mdash;the imbrication of the
  segments, and the forceps terminating the body. The development, so far as it is known, is that of
  the normal Orthoptera. Thus the Forficulidae are a very distinct division of Orthoptera, the
  characters that separate them being comparatively slight, though there are no intermediate forms.
  Some of those who treat the Dermaptera as a sub-Order equivalent to the rest of the divisions of
  the Order, call the latter combination Euorthoptera.</p>

  errors and supplying us with information on numerous points. M. de Saussure described the Insect
  as possessing two lower lips, each bearing articulated palpi, and he therefore proposed to treat
  <i>Hemimerus</i> as the representative of a distinct Order of Insects, to be called Diploglossata.
  It now appears that the talented Swiss entomologist was in this case deceived by a bad
  preparation, and that the mouth shows but little departure from the ordinary mandibulate type.
  There is a large inflexed labrum; <span class="pagenum" id="page218"><span
  class="smaller">{218}</span></span>the mandibles are concealed by the maxillae, but are large,
  compressed, and on their inner edge toothed. The maxillae are well developed, are surmounted by
  two lobes and bear five-jointed palpi. The ligula appears to be broad and short, and formed of two
  parts longitudinally divided; the short palpi consist of three segments. The mentum is very large.
  The lingua is present in the form of a free pubescent lobe with a smaller lobe on each side. The
  structure of the pleura is not fully understood; that of the abdomen seems to be very like the
  earwigs, with a similar difference in the sexes. The cerci are something like those of Gryllidae,
  being long, flexible, and unsegmented. The legs have rather small coxae, and three-jointed tarsi,
  two of which are densely studded with fine hairs beneath, as in Coleoptera. It is difficult to
  detect the stigmata, but Dr. Hansen believes there are ten pairs.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The species described by Dr. Hansen as <i>H. talpoides</i> is probably distinct
  from that of Walker, though both come from equatorial West Africa. Dr. Hansen's species, which may
  be called <i>H. hanseni</i>, has been found living on the body of a large rat, <i>Cricetomys
  gambianus</i>; the Insect occurred on a few specimens only of the mammal, but when found was
  present in considerable numbers; it runs with rapidity among the hairs and apparently also
  springs. The nature of its food is by no means clear. Not the least remarkable fact in connexion
  with this peculiar Insect is its gestation. The young are borne inside the mother, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page219"><span class="smaller">{219}</span></span>apparently about six at a
  time, the larger one being of course the nearest to the orifice. Dr. Hansen thinks the young
  specimens are connected with the walls of the maternal passages by means of a process from the
  neck of each. But the details of this and other points are insufficiently ascertained; it is,
  indeed, difficult to understand how, with a process of the kind of which a fragment is shown in
  Fig. 116, <i>b</i>, the Insect could fix itself after a detachment for change of position. The
  young is said to be very like the adult, but with a simpler structure of the antennae and abdomen.
  On the whole, it appears probable that <i>Hemimerus</i> is, as stated by Dr. Hansen, a special
  family of Orthoptera allied to Forficulidae; further information both as to structure and
  development are, however, required, as the material at the disposition of the Swedish entomologist
  was very small.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Blattidae, or cockroaches, are an extensive family of Insects, very much neglected by
  collectors, and known to the ordinary observer chiefly from the fact that a few species have <span
  class="pagenum" id="page221"><span class="smaller">{221}</span></span>become naturalised in
  various parts of the world in the houses of man. One such species is abundant in Britain, and is
  the "black beetle" of popular language; the use of the word beetle in connexion with cockroaches
  is, however, entomologically incorrect. One or two members of the family are also well known,
  owing to their being used as the "corpora vilia" for students commencing anatomical investigation
  of the Arthropoda; for this purpose they are recommended by their comparatively large size and the
  ease with which an abundant supply of specimens may always be procured, but it must be admitted
  that in some respects they give but a poor idea of Insect-structure, and that to some persons they
  are very repulsive.</p>

  <p>The inflexed position of the head is one of the most characteristic features of the Blattidae;
  in activity it is partially released from this posture, but the mouth does not appear to be
  capable of the full extension forwards that is found in other Insects that inflex the head in
  repose. The labium is deeply divided, the lingua forms a large lobe reposing on the cleft. The
  maxillary palpi have two basal short joints, and three longer joints beyond these; the labial
  palps consist of three joints of moderate length. The under-surface of the head is formed in large
  part by the submentum, which extends back to the occipital foramen.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The front of the head is the aspect that in repose looks directly downwards; the larger part of
  it is formed by the clypeus, which is separated from the epicranium by a very fine suture angulate
  in the middle; there is a large many-facetted eye on each side; near to the eye a circular space
  serves for the insertion of the antenna; close to this and to the eye there is a peculiar small
  area of paler colour, frequently membranous, called the fenestra, and which in the males of
  <i>Corydia</i> and <span class="pagenum" id="page222"><span
  class="smaller">{222}</span></span><i>Heterogamia</i> is replaced by an ocellus. The antennae are
  very elongate and consist of a large number of minute rings or joints, frequently about 100. The
  head is not inserted directly in the thorax, as is the case in so many Insects; but the front of
  the thorax has a very large opening, thus the neck between it and the head is of more than usual
  importance; it includes six cervical sclerites.</p>

  <p>The pronotum is more or less like a shield in form, and frequently entirely conceals the head,
  and thus looks like the most anterior part of the body; usually it has no marked angles, but in
  some of the apterous forms the hind angles are sharp and project backwards. In contrast to the
  pronotum the prosternum is small and feeble, and consists of a slender lateral strip on each side,
  the two converging behind to unite with a median piece, the prosternum proper. None of these
  pieces of the ventral aspect of the prothorax are ordinarily visible, the side-pieces being
  covered by the inflexed head, and the median piece by the great coxae. In some of the winged
  Blattidae (<i>Blabera</i>, e.g.) there is at the base of each anterior coxa a small space covered
  by a more delicate membrane, that suggests the possibility of the existence of a sensory organ
  there (Fig. 120, <i>i</i>).<a id="NtA_146" href="#Nt_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a> At the base
  of&mdash;above and behind&mdash;the front coxa the prothoracic spiracle is situate.</p>

  <p>The meso- and meta-thoracic segments differ but slightly from one another; the notal or dorsal
  pieces are moderately large, while the sternal or ventral are remarkably rudimentary, and are
  frequently divided on the middle line. Connected with the posterior part of each sternum there is
  a piece, bent upwards, called by some anatomists the furca; when the sterna are divided the furca
  may extend forwards between them; in other <span class="pagenum" id="page223"><span
  class="smaller">{223}</span></span>cases it is so obscure externally as to leave its existence in
  some doubt.</p>

  <p>The sterna in Blattidae are remarkable for their rudimentary structure. This is probably
  correlated with the great development of the coxae, which serve as shields to the lower part of
  the body. The pieces of the sterna are not only small, but are also of feeble
  consistence&mdash;semi-membranous, in fact&mdash;and appear like thicker portions of the more
  extensive and delicate membrane in which they are situate; they sometimes differ considerably in
  the sexes of the same species. The coxae have very large bases, and between them and the sterna
  are some pieces that are grooved and plicate, so that it is not easy to decide as to their
  distinctions and homology (Fig. 120). The second breathing orifice is a slit placed in a horny
  area in the membrane between the middle and hind coxae.</p>

  <p>The legs are remarkable for the large and numerous spines borne by the tibiae, and frequently
  also by the femora: the trochanters are distinct and of moderate size; the tarsi are five-jointed,
  frequently the basal four joints are furnished with a pad beneath; the fifth joint is elongate,
  bears two claws, and frequently between these a projecting lobe or arolium; this process scarcely
  exists in the young of <i>Stilopyga orientalis</i>, the common cockroach, though it is well
  developed in the adult. The hind body or abdomen is always large, and its division into rings is
  very visible, but the exact number of these that can be seen varies according to age, sex,
  species, and to whether the dorsal or ventral surface be examined. The differences are chiefly due
  to the retraction and inflexion of the apical segments; the details of the form of these parts
  differ in nearly every species. It is, however, considered that ten dorsal and ventral plates
  exist, though the latter are not so easily demonstrated as the former. The basal segment is often
  much diminished, the first dorsal plate being closely connected with the metanotum, while the
  first ventral may be still more rudimentary; much variety exists on this point. In the female two
  of the ventral terminal plates are frequently inflexed, so as to be quite invisible without
  dissection. From the sides of the tenth segment spring the cerci, flat or compressed processes
  very various in size, length, and form, usually more or less distinctly jointed. Systematists call
  the seventh ventral plate of the <span class="pagenum" id="page224"><span
  class="smaller">{224}</span></span>female the "lamina subgenitalis," or the "lamina subgenitalis
  spuria," the concealed eighth plate being in this latter case considered the true subgenital
  plate. In the male this term is applied to the ventral plate of the ninth segment, the
  corresponding dorsal plate being called the "lamina supra-analis." These terms are much used in
  the systematic definitions of the genera and larger groups.</p>

  <p>The males, in addition to the cerci alluded to as common to both sexes, are provided on the
  hind margin of the lamina subgenitalis with a pair of slender styles. These are wanting in the
  females, but in the common cockroach the young individuals of that sex are provided, like the
  male, with these peculiar organs. M. Peytoureau has described<a id="NtA_147"
  href="#Nt_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a> the mode of their disappearance, viz. by a series of changes
  at the ecdyses. Cholodkovsky, who has examined the styles, considers them to be embryologically
  the homologues of true legs.<a id="NtA_148" href="#Nt_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a> These styles are
  said not to be present in any shape in some species&mdash;<i>Ectobia</i>, <i>Panesthia</i>, etc.;
  this probably refers only to the adults. In some cases a curious condition occurs, inasmuch as one
  of the two styles is absent, and is replaced by a notch on the right side, thus causing an
  asymmetry&mdash;<i>Phyllodromia</i>, <i>Temnopteryx</i>, etc.</p>

  <p>It has been found in several species that there are eight pairs of abdominal spiracles, making,
  with the two thoracic, ten pairs in all. The first of the abdominal spiracles is larger than the
  others, and in the winged species may be easily detected by raising the tegmina and wings, it
  being more dorsal in position than those following, which are in some species exposed on the
  ventral surface owing to the cutting away of the hind angles of the ventral plates; but the
  terminal spiracles are in all cases difficult to detect, and it is possible that the number may
  not be the same in all the species of the family. The cerci exhibit a great deal of variety. In
  the species with elongate tegmina and wings the cerci are elongate, and are like antennae in
  structure; in many of the purely apterous forms the cerci appear to be entirely absent (cf. Fig.
  130, <i>Gromphadorhina</i>), but on examination may be found to exist in the form of a small
  plate, or papilla scarcely protuberant. In the males of <i>Heterogamia</i> they are, on the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page225"><span class="smaller">{225}</span></span>contrary, very like little
  antennae; in the unwinged females of this genus they are concealed in a chink existing on the
  under-surface of the apex of the body.</p>

  <p>The alar organs of Blattidae are of considerable interest from several points of view. They
  exist in various conditions as regards size and development, and in some forms are very large;
  each tegmen in some species of the genus <i>Blabera</i> (Fig. 132) may attain a length of nearly
  three inches; in other cases wings and tegmina are entirely absent, and various intermediate
  conditions are found. In Fig. 121 we give a diagram of the tegmen or front wing, A, and the hind
  wing, B, to explain the principal nervures and areas. The former are four in number, and, adopting
  Brunner's nomenclature<a id="NtA_149" href="#Nt_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a> for them, are named
  proceeding from before backwards mediastinal, <i>a</i>; radial, <i>b</i>; infra-median (or ulnar),
  <i>c</i>; and dividens, <i>d</i>. An adventitious vein, vena spuria, existing in the hind wings of
  certain genera is marked <i>sp</i> in B.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      scapular or radial; 3, median; 4, anal or axillary.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The vena dividens is of great importance, as it marks off the anal or axillary field, which in
  both tegmen and wing has a different system of minor veins from what obtains in the rest of the
  organ; the veins being in the anterior region abundantly branching and dichotomous (Fig. 132),
  while in the anal field there is but little furcation, though the nervures converge much at the
  base. The mediastinal gives off minor veins towards the front only, the radial gives off veinlets
  at first towards the front, but nearer the tip of the wings sends off minor veins both backwards
  and forwards. The infra-median or ulnar vein is very variable; it is frequently <span
  class="pagenum" id="page226"><span class="smaller">{226}</span></span>abbreviated, and on the
  whole is of subordinate importance to the other three. These latter thus form four chief areas or
  fields, viz.&mdash;1, mediastinal or marginal; 2, scapular or radial; 3, median; and 4, anal.
  These nervures and divisions may be traced in a large number of existing and fossil Blattidae, but
  there are forms existing at present which it is difficult to reduce to the same plan. In
  <i>Euthyrhapha</i>, found in the Pacific Islands, the hind wings are long and project beyond the
  tegmina, and have a very peculiar arrangement of the nervures; the species of <i>Holocampsa</i>
  also possess abnormal alar organs, while the structure of these parts in <i>Diaphana</i> (Fig.
  122) is so peculiar that Brunner wisely refrains from attempting to homologise their nervures with
  those of the more normal Blattidae. The alar organs are frequently extremely different in the two
  sexes of the same species of Blattidae, and the hind wing may differ much from the tegmen as
  regards degree of departure from the normal. So that it is not a matter for surprise that the
  nervures in different genera cannot be satisfactorily homologised.</p>

  <p>But the most peculiar wings in the family are the folded structures found in some forms of the
  groups Ectobiides and Oxyhaloides [Anaplectinae and Plectopterinae of de Saussure]. These have
  been studied by de Saussure,<a id="NtA_150" href="#Nt_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a> and in Fig. 123 we
  reproduce some of his sketches, from which it will be seen that in B and C the wing is divided by
  an unusual cross-joint into two parts, the apical portion being also longitudinally divided into
  two pieces <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. Such a form of wing as is here shown has no exact parallel in
  any of the other groups of Insects, though the earwigs and some of the Coleoptera make an approach
  to it. This structure permits a very perfect folding of the wing in repose. The peculiarities
  exhibited have been explained by de Saussure somewhat as follows. In the ordinary condition of
  Orthoptera the axillary or anal field (P) when the wings are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page227"><span class="smaller">{227}</span></span>closed collapses like a fan, and also
  doubles under the anterior part (H) of the wing along the line <i>a a</i>, in Fig. 123, A, the
  result being similar to that shown by our Fig. 124. It will be noticed in Fig. 123, A, that a
  small triangular area (<i>t</i>) exists at the tip of the wing just where the fold takes place, so
  that when the wing is shut this little piece is liberated, as shown in <i>t</i>, Fig. 124. In many
  Blattidae, e.g. <i>Blabera</i> (Fig. 132), no trace of this little intercalated piece can be
  found, but in others it exists in various degrees of development intermediate between what is
  shown in <i>Thorax porcellana</i> (Fig. 123, A) and in <i>Anaplecta azteca</i> (123, B), so that
  <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> of the latter may be looked on as a greater development of the condition shown
  in A at <i>t</i>. It will be noticed that the superadded part of the wing of 123, B, possesses no
  venation, being traversed only by the line along which it folds; but in the wing of <i>Diploptera
  silpha</i>, 123, C, the corresponding part is complexly venated. This venation, as Brunner says,<a
  id="NtA_151" href="#Nt_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a> is not an extension of the ordinary venation of
  the wing, but is <i>sui generis</i>. It is curious that though all the degrees of development
  between A and B exist in various forms of the tribes Ectobiides and Oxyhaloides, yet there is
  nothing to connect the veined apex of Diploptera with the unveined one of <i>Anaplecta</i>.</p>

  <p>The internal anatomy of Blattids has been investigated in only one or two species. There are no
  great peculiarities, but some features of minor interest exist.  The alimentary canal (Fig. 125)
  is remarkable <span class="pagenum" id="page228"><span class="smaller">{228}</span></span>on
  account of the capacious crop, and the small gut-like, chylific ventricle; eight elongate pouches
  are situate on this latter part at its junction with the gizzard.</p>

  <p>The Malpighian tubules are very numerous and delicate; there are extensive salivary glands and
  reservoirs; and on the anterior part of the true stomach there are eight caecal diverticula. The
  great chain of the nervous system consists in all of eleven ganglia&mdash;two cephalic, three
  thoracic, and six abdominal.</p>

  <p>The ovaries in <i>Stilopyga orientalis</i> consist each of eight egg-tubes, placed at the
  periphery of a common receptacle or oviduct, the pair of receptacles themselves opening into a
  common chamber&mdash;the uterus&mdash;which is surrounded by a much branching serific or
  colleterial gland. In this chamber the egg-case is formed from the secretion of the gland just
  mentioned. According to Miall and Denny,<a id="NtA_152" href="#Nt_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> there
  is a spermatheca which opens not into the uterus but into the cloacal chamber behind it. Lowne
  doubts this diverticulum being a true spermatheca. The manner in which the eggs are fertilised and
  their capsule modelled is uncertain.<a id="NtA_153" href="#Nt_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The internal reproductive organs of the male are very complex in <i>Stilopyga orientalis</i>;
  each testis consists of a number (30 to 40) of vesicles placed on a tube which is prolonged to
  form the vas deferens. There is a very peculiar large complex gland consisting of longer and
  shorter utricles, opening into the vesiculae seminales, and forming a "mushroom-shaped gland."<a
  id="NtA_154" href="#Nt_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a> <span class="pagenum" id="page229"><span
  class="smaller">{229}</span></span>This gland is much larger than the testes proper, which, it is
  said, lose early their functional activity in the species in question, and shrivel. There is
  another important accessory gland, the conglobate gland of Miall and Denny, opening on a portion
  of the external copulatory armour.</p>

  <p>Although some species of Blattidae are domesticated in our houses, and their bodies have been
  dissected by a generation of anatomists, very little is known as to their life histories. The
  common "black beetle" of the kitchen is said by Cornelius to be several years in attaining the
  adult state. Observations made at Cambridge by the writer, as well as others now being carried on
  there by Mr. H. H. Brindley, quite confirm this view, the extent of growth accomplished in several
  months being surprisingly little, and the amount of food consumed very small. It is therefore not
  improbable that the life of an individual of this species may extend to five years.
  <i>Phyllodromia germanica</i>, a species that is abundant in the dwellings of the peoples of
  north-eastern Europe, attains its full development in the course of a few months.</p>

  <p>We have already alluded to the fact that in the Blattidae the eggs are laid in a capsule formed
  in the interior of the mother-Insect. This capsule is a horny case varying much in size and
  somewhat less in form in the different species; it is borne about for some time by the mother, who
  may not infrequently be seen running about with it protruding from the hinder part of the body.
  Sooner or later the capsule is deposited in a suitable situation, and the young cockroaches
  emerge; it is said that they are sometimes liberated by the aid of the mother. Mr. Brindley has
  found it very difficult to procure the hatching of the young from their capsules.</p>

  </div>

  <p>It is known that some Blattidae are viviparous.  In the case of one such species, <i>Panchlora
  viridis</i>, it appears probable that the egg-capsule is either wanting, or is present in only a
  very imperfect form.<a id="NtA_155" href="#Nt_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

  <p>On emerging the young <i>Blatta</i> is in general form very similar to the parent, though
  usually much paler in colour.  After casting <span class="pagenum" id="page230"><span
  class="smaller">{230}</span></span>the skin an uncertain number of times&mdash;not less than five,
  probably as many as seven&mdash;it reaches the adult condition, the changes of outer form that it
  undergoes being of a gradual nature, except that at the last ecdysis the wings&mdash;in the case
  of the winged species&mdash;make their appearance, and the terminal segments of the body undergo a
  greater change of form. What mutations of shape may be undergone by the thoracic segments previous
  to the final production of the wings has not apparently been accurately recorded, Fischer's
  opinion being evidently based on very slight observation. The little that has been recorded as to
  the post-embryonic development since the observations of Hummel<a id="NtA_156"
  href="#Nt_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a> and Cornelius<a id="NtA_157"
  href="#Nt_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a> will be found in the works of Brunner.<a id="NtA_158"
  href="#Nt_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> According to this latter authority, in the wingless species
  the terminal segments of the body have the same form in the early stages as they have in the adult
  state, so that this latter condition can only be recognised by the greater hardness of the
  integument. When tegmina or wings are present in a well-developed form in a Blattid, it is certain
  that the Insect is adult; and when there can be seen at the side of the mesonotum or metanotum a
  piece, however small, separated by a distinct suture, it may be correctly assumed that the
  individual is an adult of a species having only rudimentary alar organs. The adult female of the
  common <i>Stilopyga orientalis</i> shows this phenomenon.</p>

  <p>The cockroaches are remarkable for the excessive rapidity with which they run, or rather
  scurry, their gait being very peculiar. The common domestic forms, when alarmed, disappear with
  great agility, seeking obscure corners in which to hide themselves, it being part of their
  instinct to flee from light. Hence they are called lucifugous, and are most of them entirely
  nocturnal in their activities. In the South of Europe and other warmer regions many Blattidae may,
  however, be found on bushes and foliage in the daytime; these, when alarmed, fall down and run off
  with such speed and in so tortuous a manner, that it is a very difficult matter to seize them. It
  is recorded that the males of the genus <i>Heterogamia</i> are attracted by lights, though their
  apterous females keep themselves concealed underground in sandy places.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page231"><span class="smaller">{231}</span></span></div>

  <p>We may take this opportunity of alluding to the attraction that light exerts on Insects. Many
  species that conceal themselves during the daytime and shun light as if it were disagreeable, are
  at night-time so fascinated by it that it is the cause of their destruction. The quantity of
  Insects killed in this way by electric and other bright lights is now enormous; in many species
  the individuals immolate themselves by myriads. It would appear that only nocturnal and winged
  species are so attracted. So far as we know, light has no fascination for Insects except when they
  are on the wing. The phenomenon is not understood at present.</p>

  <p>The food of Blattidae is believed to be of a very mixed character, though Brunner considers
  that dead animal matter is the natural nutriment of the members of this family. It is well known
  that the common cockroach eats a variety of peculiar substances; its individuals undoubtedly have
  the somewhat too economical habit of eating their own cast skins and empty egg-capsules, but in
  this they only act like many other much admired Insects. <i>S. orientalis</i> is gregarious, and
  the individuals are very amicable with one another; small specimens sit on, or run over the big
  individuals, and even nestle under them without their displaying the least resentment. The common
  cockroach is a rather amusing pet, as the creatures occasionally assume most comical attitudes,
  especially when cleaning their limbs; this they do somewhat after the fashion of cats, extending
  the head as far as they can in the desired direction, and then passing a leg or antenna through
  the mouth; or they comb other parts of the body with the spines on the legs, sometimes twisting
  and distorting themselves considerably in order to reach some not very accessible part of the
  body.</p>

  <p>There is very little information extant as to the domestic Blattidae found in parts of the
  world outside Europe, but it seems that there are numerous species that prefer the dwellings of
  man, even though they only tolerate the owners. Belt says<a id="NtA_159"
  href="#Nt_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a> "the cockroaches that infest the houses of the tropics are
  very wary, as they have numerous enemies&mdash;birds, rats, scorpions, and spiders; their long
  trembling antennae are ever stretched out, vibrating as if feeling the very texture of the air
  around them; and their long legs quickly take them out of danger. Sometimes <span class="pagenum"
  id="page232"><span class="smaller">{232}</span></span>I tried to chase one of them up to a corner
  where on a wall a large cockroach-eating spider stood motionless looking out for his prey; the
  cockroach would rush away from me in the greatest fear, but as soon as it came within a foot of
  its mortal foe nothing would force it onwards, but back it would double, facing all the danger
  from me rather than advance nearer to its natural enemy." To this we may add that cockroaches are
  the natural prey of the fossorial Hymenoptera of the group Ampulicides, and that these wasps
  sometimes enter houses in search of the Insects.</p>

  <p>We have already noticed the considerable difference that exists in many cases between the sexes
  of the same species. This is sometimes carried to such an extent that nothing but direct
  observation could make us believe that the males and females are of one kin. Fig. 118 (<span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page220">220</a></span>) shows a case of this kind. Though the young as a
  rule are excessively similar to the adults, yet this is by no means invariably the case. In some
  of the more amply winged forms, such as <i>Blabera</i>, the young is about as different from the
  adult as the female of <i>Heterogamia</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page233"><span
  class="smaller">{233}</span></span>is from its male. In Blattidae it is always the case&mdash;so
  far as is yet known&mdash;that when there is a difference as regards the alar organs between the
  two sexes, it is the male that has these structures most developed, and this even when they can be
  of little or no use for purposes of flight.</p>

  <p>Among the most interesting forms of the family are the two species of the genus
  <i>Nocticola</i>, recently discovered by M. Simon in caves in the Philippine Islands.<a
  id="NtA_160" href="#Nt_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a> They are amongst the smallest of the Orthoptera,
  the male being scarcely &#x215B; of an inch long. In the larval state of <i>N. simoni</i> the
  ocular organs exist as three ocelli, or facets, on each side of the head, and in the perfect state
  the number is increased somewhat, as shown in Fig. 127, A<sub>2</sub>. In the second species of
  the genus the female is quite blind (the male being still undiscovered). The fenestr&aelig; in
  <i>Nocticola</i> are absent; the tegmina and wings are totally wanting in the female (Fig. 127,
  B), but are present in a very peculiar condition in the male (Fig. 127, A<sub>1</sub>). There are
  other anomalies in the structure of these cavernicolous Insects, the cerci being apparently of
  peculiar structure, and the spines of the legs more hair-like than usual. The condition of the
  eyes is remarkable; the peculiarity in their development is worthy of study.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>To those who are acquainted with Blattidae only through our domestic "black beetle" it may seem
  absurd to talk of elegance in connexion with cockroaches. Yet there are numerous forms in which
  grace and beauty are attained, and some exhibit peculiarities of ornamentation that are worthy of
  attention. <i>Corydia petiveriana</i> (Fig. 128) is a common cockroach in East India. It has an
  effective system of coloration, the under wings and the sides of the body being vividly coloured
  with orange yellow; when the tegmina are closed the upper surface of the body is of a velvet-black
  colour, with cream-coloured marks; these spots are different <span class="pagenum"
  id="page234"><span class="smaller">{234}</span></span>on the two tegmina, as shown in Fig. 128, A,
  but are so arranged that when the tegmina are closed (Fig. 128, B) a symmetrical pattern is
  produced by the combination of the marks of the two differently spotted tegmina. It is very
  curious to notice the great difference in the colour of the part of the right tegmen that is
  overlapped by the edge of the left one; this part of the tegmen being coloured orange yellow in
  harmony with the wings. The result of the remarkable differentiation of the colours of the two
  tegmina may be summarised by saying that on the right one the colour of a part is abruptly
  contrasted with that of the rest of the organ, so as to share the system of coloration of the
  under-wings and body, while the corresponding part of the other tegmen is very different, and
  completes the system of symmetrical ornamentation of the upper surface.</p>

  <p>Many other members of the Blattidae have an elegant appearance, and depart more or less from
  their fellows in structural characters, with the result of adding to their graceful appearance; in
  such cases, so far as at present known, these Insects are brightly coloured. Thus <i>Hypnorna
  amoena</i> (Fig. 129) has the antennae banded in white, black, and red, while the overlapping part
  of the tegmina is arranged so as to bring the line of junction between them nearly straight along
  the middle line of the body, and thus produce a more symmetrical appearance than we find in other
  cockroaches. The head in this Insect is not so concealed as usual, and this undoubtedly adds
  somewhat to the effective appearance of this cockroach. This visibility of the front of the head
  in <i>Hypnorna</i> is not, as would be supposed, owing to its being less inflexed than usual. On
  the contrary, the head is quite as strongly inflexed as it is in other Blattidae, but the part
  just at the front of the thorax is unusually elongate, so that the eyes are exposed and the Insect
  has a larger field of vision. This interesting Insect belongs to the tribe Oxyhaloides
  [Plectopterinae Sauss.], in which group the most highly developed folded wings occur.</p>

  <p>The wingless forms never exhibit the grace and elegance possessed by some of the more active of
  the winged Blattidae. <span class="pagenum" id="page235"><span
  class="smaller">{235}</span></span>One of them, <i>Gromphadorhina portentosa</i>, found in
  Madagascar (Fig. 130), is a very robust Insect, and attains a length of 78  millim.&mdash;somewhat
  more than 3 inches.  This Insect has projections on the thorax that remind us of the horns that
  exist in some of the Lamellicorn beetles.</p>

  <p>Little has been yet written as to the resemblances of Blattidae to other species of their own
  family, or to other creatures, but it is probable that such similarities will be found to prevail
  to a considerable extent. W. A. Forbes has called attention<a id="NtA_161"
  href="#Nt_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> to the larva of a Blattid from Brazil as being remarkable for
  its superficial resemblance to an Isopod crustacean. Some of the wingless forms have a great
  resemblance to the small rolling-up Myriapods of the group Glomerides; <i>Pseudoglomeris
  fornicata</i>, of which we figure the female (Fig. 131), has received its name from this
  resemblance. The females of the S. African genus <i>Derocalymma</i> possess this Glomerid
  appearance, and have a peculiar structure of the prothorax, admitting of a more complete
  protection of the head. Brunner states that the wingless kinds of <i>Derocalymma</i> roll
  themselves up like wood-lice. In many of the forms of this tribe&mdash;Perisphaeriides&mdash;the
  males are winged, though the females are so like Myriapods. According to de Saussure<a
  id="NtA_162" href="#Nt_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a> the gigantic <i>Megaloblatta rufipes</i> bears an
  extreme resemblance in appearance to the large cockroaches of the genus <i>Blabera</i>.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Some of the species of <i>Holocompsa</i> remind us strongly of Hemiptera of the family
  Capsidae; they have an arrangement of colours similar to what prevails in that group, and their
  tegmina and wings which, as being those of Blattids may be said to be abnormally formed, resemble
  in texture and the distribution of the venation those of the Hemiptera. These Insects are closely
  allied to <i>Diaphana</i>, of which genus we have figured a species (Fig. 122).</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page236"><span class="smaller">{236}</span></span></div>

  <p>There is very little evidence on which to base an estimate of the number of species of
  Blattidae existing in the world at present. Probably the number extant in collections may amount
  to 1000 or thereabouts, and the total existing in the world may be as many as 5000. The species of
  Blattidae cannot tolerate cold, and are consequently only numerous in tropical regions. Europe
  possesses about twenty species, and in Britain there are only three that are truly native; these
  are all small Insects belonging to the genus <i>Ectobia</i>, and living out of doors, amongst
  leaves, under bushes, and in various other places. We have, however, several other species that
  have been introduced by the agency of man, and these all live under cover, where there is
  artificial warmth and they are protected from the inclemencies of the winter season. The commonest
  of these forms is <i>Stilopyga orientalis</i>, the "black beetle" of our kitchens and bakehouses.
  This Insect is said to have been brought to Europe from "Asia" about 200 years ago, but the
  evidence as to its introduction, and as to the country of which it is really a native, is very
  slight. It is indeed said<a id="NtA_163" href="#Nt_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> that <i>S.
  orientalis</i> has been found in peat in Schleswig-Holstein. <i>Periplaneta americana</i> is a
  larger Insect, and is common in some places; it is apparently the species that is most usually
  found on board ships, where it sometimes multiplies enormously, and entirely devours stores of
  farinaceous food to which it obtains access: it is known that sometimes a box or barrel supposed
  to contain biscuits, on being opened is found to have its edible contents entirely replaced by a
  mass of living cockroaches. Fortunately <i>Periplaneta americana</i> has not spread widely in this
  country, though it is found in great numbers in limited localities; one of the best known of which
  is the Zoological Gardens in the Regent's Park at London. <i>Periplaneta australasiae</i> is very
  similar to <i>P. americana</i>, but has a yellow mark on the shoulder of each tegmen. This has
  obtained a footing in some of the glass-houses in the Botanic Gardens at Cambridge and Kew; and it
  is said to be fairly well established in Belfast. Another of our introduced domestic cockroaches
  is <i>Phyllodromia germanica</i>, a much smaller Insect than the others we have mentioned. It has
  only established itself at a few places in this country, but it is extremely abundant in some
  parts of Northern and Eastern Europe. It has been increasing in numbers in Vienna, where,
  according to Brunner, it is <span class="pagenum" id="page237"><span
  class="smaller">{237}</span></span>displacing <i>Stilopyga orientalis</i>. In addition to these,
  <i>Rhyparobia maderae</i> and species of the genus <i>Blabera</i> have been met with in our docks,
  and are possibly always to be found there. They are Insects of much larger size than those we have
  mentioned. We figure the alar organs of one of these species of <i>Blabera</i> of the natural
  size: the species in this genus are extremely similar to one another. Blaberae are known in the
  West Indies as drummers, it being supposed that they make a noise at night,<a id="NtA_164"
  href="#Nt_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a> but details in confirmation of this statement are wanting.</p>

  </div>

  <p>It is a remarkable fact that no satisfactory reasons can be assigned for the prevalence of one
  rather than another of these domestic cockroaches in particular localities. It does not seem to
  depend at all on size, or on the period of development, for the three species <i>Stilopyga
  orientalis</i>, <i>Periplaneta americana</i>, and <i>Phyllodromia germanica</i>, which are the
  most abundant, differ much in these respects, and replace one another in particular localities, so
  that it does not appear that any one is gaining a permanent or widespread superiority as compared
  with another. There are, however, no sufficient records on these points, and further investigation
  may reveal facts of which we are at present ignorant, and which will throw some light on this
  subject. We may remark that Mr. Brindley has found it more difficult to obtain hatching of the
  young from the egg-capsules of <i>Periplaneta americana</i> and <i>Phyllodromia germanica</i> at
  Cambridge, than from those of <i>Stilopyga orientalis</i>.</p>

  <p>Although much work has been done on the embryology of Blattidae, the subject is still very
  incomplete. The recent memoirs of Cholodkovsky<a id="NtA_165" href="#Nt_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a>
  on <i>Phyllodromia germanica</i> contain so much of general interest as to the development of the
  external parts of the body that we may briefly allude to them. The earliest appearance of
  segmentation appears to be due to the centralisation of numerous <span class="pagenum"
  id="page238"><span class="smaller">{238}</span></span>cells round certain points in the ventral
  plate. The segmentation of the anterior parts is first distinct, and the appearance of the
  appendages of the body takes place in regular order from before backwards, the antennae appearing
  first; the mandibles, however, become distinct only subsequent to the maxillae and thoracic
  appendages. There are in the course of the development appendages to each segment of the body (he
  counts eleven abdominal segments); the cerci develop in a similar manner to the antennae; the
  first pair of abdominal appendages&mdash;at first similar to the others&mdash;afterwards assume a
  peculiar stalked form. The abdominal appendages subsequently disappear, with the exception of the
  ninth pair, which form the ventral styles, and the eleventh pair, which become the cerci. The last
  ventral segment is said to be formed by the union of the tenth and eleventh embryonic ventral
  segments.</p>

  </div>

  <p>As regards their Palaeontological forms Blattidae are amongst the most interesting of Insects,
  for it is certain that in the Carboniferous epoch they existed in considerable number and variety.
  A still earlier fossil has been found in the Silurian sandstone of Calvados; it consists of a
  fragment (Fig. 133, A), looking somewhat like an imperfect tegmen of a Blattid; it was described
  by Brongniart under the name of <i>Palaeoblattina douvillei</i>, and referred by him, with some
  doubt, to this family. Brauer has, however, expressed the opinion<a id="NtA_166"
  href="#Nt_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a> that the fragment more probably belonged to an Insect like the
  mole-cricket, and in view of this discrepancy of authorities we may be pardoned for expressing our
  own opinion to the effect that the relic has no connexion with the Insecta. The figure given by
  Scudder<a id="NtA_167" href="#Nt_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a> has not, however, so uninsect-like an
  appearance as that we have copied from Brauer. Whatever may prove to be the case with regard to
  <i>Palaeoblattina</i>, it is certain, as we <span class="pagenum" id="page239"><span
  class="smaller">{239}</span></span>have already said, that in the Palaeozoic epoch Insects similar
  to our existing cockroaches were abundant, their remains being found in plenty in the
  coal-measures both of Europe and North America. Fig. 133, B, shows a fossil tegmen of
  <i>Etoblattina manebachensis</i> from the upper Carboniferous beds of Ilmenau in Germany. It will
  be noticed that the disposition of the nervures is very much like that which may be seen in some
  of our existing Blattidae (cf. the tegmen of <i>Blabera</i>, Fig. 132, A), the vena dividens
  (<i>a</i>) being similarly placed, as is also the mediastinal vein on the front part of the organ.
  The numerous carboniferous Blattidae have been separated as a distinct Order of Insects by Scudder
  under the name Palaeoblattariae, but apparently rather on theoretical grounds than because of any
  ascertained important structural distinctions. He also divided the Palaeoblattariae into two
  groups, Mylacridae and Blattinariae, the former of which was supposed to be peculiar to America.
  Brongniart has, however, recently discovered that in the Carboniferous deposits of Commentry in
  France Mylacridae are as common as in America. This latter authority also states that some of the
  females of these fossil Blattidae are distinguished by the presence of an elongate exserted organ
  at the end of the body. He considers this to have been an ovipositor by which the eggs were
  deposited in trees or other receptacles, after a manner that is common in certain Orthoptera at
  the present day. If this view be correct these Carboniferous Insects must have been very different
  from the Blattidae of our own epoch, one of whose marked characteristics is the deposition of the
  eggs in a capsule formed in the body of the parent.</p>

  <p>In the strata of the secondary epoch remains of Blattidae have also been discovered in both
  Europe and America, in Oolitic, Liassic, and Triassic deposits. From the Tertiary strata, on the
  other hand, comparatively few species have been brought to light. A few have been discovered
  preserved in amber.</p>

  <p>The classification of the Blattidae is attended with considerable difficulty on account of the
  numerous wingless forms, and of the <span class="pagenum" id="page240"><span
  class="smaller">{240}</span></span>extreme difference in the organisation of the two sexes of many
  species. It has, however, been brought to a fairly satisfactory state by the reiterated labours of
  Brunner von Wattenwyl, and we reproduce his recently perfected exposition of their characters. His
  first division is made by means of a structure which is very easily observed, viz. whether the
  femora are armed with spines, as in Fig. 134, or not. The terms used in connexion with the wings
  and other parts of the body we have already explained.</p>

  <p>Brunner's system is adopted by de Saussure,<a id="NtA_168" href="#Nt_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a>
  who, however, proposes to replace the names Ectobiides and Oxyhaloides by Anaplectinae and
  Plectopterinae. He also proposes to apply the generic name <i>Blatta</i> to the Insect that is now
  so frequently called <i>Phyllodromia germanica</i> in zoological works. If that view be adopted,
  Brunner's group Phyllodromiides will be called Blattides.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Mantidae are an extensive family of Orthoptera, showing extreme variety in the shapes and
  outlines of the body, and characterised by the very remarkable front legs; the function of these
  legs being to seize and hold their prey, which consists of living Insects, Mantidae being
  carnivorous and highly voracious.</p>

  <p>The labium is deeply divided, each half exhibiting a very near approach to the structure of a
  maxilla; there is a large membranous lingua reposing on the inner face of the lower lip. The head
  is quite free from the thorax, its front part being deflexed, and even somewhat inflexed, so that
  the mouth is directed downwards and somewhat backwards: it is very mobile, being connected to the
  thorax by a comparatively slender neck, which is, however, concealed by the pronotum. There are
  two large, prominent eyes, the antennae are frequently very slender, but they sometimes differ
  according to sex, and in some genera are pectinate in the male; just above and between their
  insertion are three ocelli placed in a triangle, two above, one below; between the antennae and
  the clypeus there is an interval called the scutellar space. In some forms of Mantidae the head
  assumes most extraordinary shapes; the eyes may become <span class="pagenum" id="page243"><span
  class="smaller">{243}</span></span>elongate and horn-like; there may be a projection between them
  bearing the ocelli, and attaining occasionally a great length; the scutellar space also may have a
  remarkable development, the whole thus forming a peculiar ornamental structure, as in Fig.
  136.</p>

  <p>The prothorax is elongate, but there are a few genera, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Eremiaphila</i>, in which
  it is exceptionally short, and there are several others in which the elongate form is more or less
  masked by foliaceous expansions of the sides. The pronotum shows near the front a transverse
  depression or seam, which marks the position of an internal chitinous ridge. The anterior legs are
  <span class="pagenum" id="page244"><span class="smaller">{244}</span></span>inserted near the
  front of the prosternum, which extends less far forwards than the pronotum does; the posterior
  part of the prosternum is very elongate, and is completely separated from the anterior part by the
  base of the coxae and the membranes attached to them; the pronotum and sternum are closely
  connected at the sides till near the posterior part where they diverge, the space so formed being
  occupied by a membrane in which the prothoracic stigma is situated. The mesothorax is as long as
  broad, and the front wings are attached to the whole length of the sides; the mesosternum is a
  triangular piece pointed behind, and bearing very large side-pieces, to the hinder portion of
  which the middle coxae are attached; these latter are large and quite free, and repose on the
  metasternum which they cover; the mesothoracic stigma may be detected as a slit situated on a
  slight prominence just behind and a little below the membranous hind-margin of the tegmen. The
  metathorax differs comparatively little in size and structure from the mesothorax; the membranous
  hind wings are attached to the sides of the notum along nearly the whole length of the latter. The
  abdomen is moderately long; in each sex ten dorsal plates may be detected, and there is a pair of
  ringed cerci projecting from beneath the sides of the tenth plate. The number of ventral plates is
  more difficult to verify, the first one being much reduced; eight other plates can be demonstrated
  in the male and six in the female.</p>

  <p>The anterior legs are formed in a remarkable manner in the Mantidae, and are, in fact, the most
  characteristic feature of the family. Attached near the front of the thorax there is a very long
  coxa, to the apex of which is articulated the triangular trochanter; this bears the elongate
  femur, which is furnished on its lower face with sharp spines and teeth; the tibia which follows
  is much shorter and smaller than the femur; its lower face bears also an armature of teeth, and it
  is so articulated with <span class="pagenum" id="page245"><span
  class="smaller">{245}</span></span>the femur that it can be completely closed thereon, its teeth
  fitting in among those of the femur (Fig. 137, B); the latter has one or more longer spines
  overlapping the apical part of the tibia when contracted.  The tarsus is slender, five-jointed,
  without pad. The other two pairs of legs are simple; the hinder usually a little the longer, and
  in some species that possess powers of leaping (<i>Ameles</i>), with the femora a little thicker
  at the base.</p>

  <p>The alar organs of the Mantidae are as regards the nervures and areas fairly similar to those
  of the Blattidae. The tegmina are usually narrow, and exhibit three well-marked areas; the one in
  front or external (according as the wing is expanded or closed) is the mediastinal area; it is
  usually more elongate and occupies a larger portion of the surface of the tegmen than in
  Blattidae. The middle area, forming the larger part of the wing, is occupied by the branches of
  the radial and ulnar nervures. The third area, the anal, possesses a sort of appendage in the form
  of a small space of a more delicately membranous nature at the inner part of the base. The tegmina
  are often more or less leaf-like in texture and consistence; this character is as a rule not very
  marked, but there are a few species with the tegmina very like foliage, this being more marked in
  the female; in some, if not in all, of these cases the mediastinal area is considerably increased.
  One tegmen overlaps the other, as in Blattidae, but to a less extent, and the correlative
  asymmetry is but slight: there is frequently a pallid spot close to the main vein on the principal
  area, nearer to the base than to the extremity. The hind wings are more ample than the front, and
  of much more delicate consistence; they possess numerous veins converging to the base; the
  anterior part of the wing is firmer in consistence, and its veins are more numerously furcate;
  there are many more or less distinct minute cross-veinlets, and an elegant tinting is not
  infrequent. They close in a fan-like manner, transverse folding being unknown in the family.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page246"><span class="smaller">{246}</span></span></div>

  <p>But little has been written on the internal anatomy of the Mantidae. Dufour has described only
  very partially that of <i>M. religiosa</i>. The salivary glands are largely developed, salivary
  receptacles exist; the alimentary canal possesses eight elongate coecal diverticula placed on the
  chylific ventricle; there are about one hundred Malphigian tubules. In each ovary there are about
  40 egg-tubes, and they are joined at their bases in clusters of about half a dozen; each cluster
  has a common sinus; these sinuses are placed at intervals along a tube, which is one of two
  branches whose union forms the oviduct; there are a large number of "serific glands" of two kinds
  in the female. The testes are unusually complex in their structure.</p>

  <p>According to Schindler<a id="NtA_172" href="#Nt_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a> the Malphigian tubes
  in <i>Mantis</i> are not inserted, as usual, at the base of the intestine, but on the intestine
  itself at about one-third of its length from the base. There is some doubt about this observation.
  Schindler considers the fact, if it be such, unique.</p>

  <p>The eggs of the Mantidae are deposited in a singular manner: the female, placing the extremity
  of the body against a twig or stone, emits some foam-like matter in which the eggs are contained.
  This substance dries and forms the ootheca; whilst attaining a sufficient consistence it is
  maintained in position by the extremity of the body and the tips of the elytra, and it is shaped
  and fashioned by these parts. The eggs are not, as might be supposed, distributed at random
  through the case, but are lodged in symmetrically-arranged chambers, though how these chambers
  come into existence by the aid of so simple a mode of construction does not appear. The capsule is
  hard; it quite conceals the eggs, which might very naturally be supposed to be efficiently
  protected by their covering: this does not, however, appear to be the case, as it is recorded that
  they are subject to the attacks of Hymenopterous parasites. The time that elapses after the eggs
  are laid and before they hatch varies greatly according to circumstances. In France, <i>Mantis
  religiosa</i> deposits its eggs in September, but they do not hatch until the following June;
  while in E. India the young of another species of <i>Mantis</i> emerge from the eggs about twenty
  days after these have been deposited. Trimen has recorded some particulars as to the formation of
  its egg-case by a <i>Mantis</i> in S. Africa. This <span class="pagenum" id="page247"><span
  class="smaller">{247}</span></span>specimen constructed four nests of eggs at intervals of about a
  fortnight, and Trimen states that the four were "as nearly as possible of the same size and of
  precisely similar shape." He also describes its mode of feeding, and says that it was fond of
  house-flies, and would eat "blue-bottles," i.e. <i>Musca vomitoria</i>, but if while eating one of
  the latter a house-fly were introduced, the "blue-bottle" was generally dropped, even though it
  might be in process of being devoured. The young have to escape from the chambers in which they
  are confined in these egg-cases; they do so in a most curious manner; not by the use of the feet,
  but by means of spines directed backwards on the cerci and legs, so that when the body is agitated
  advance is made in only one direction. The eggs last deposited are said to be the first to hatch.
  On reaching the exterior the young Mantids do not fall to the ground, but remain suspended, after
  the manner of spiders, to the ootheca by means of two threads attached to the extremities of the
  cerci; in this strange position they remain for some days until the first change of skin is
  effected, after which they commence the activity of their predatory life.</p>

  <p>Dr. Pagenstecher has given an account<a id="NtA_173" href="#Nt_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a> of the
  development of <i>Mantis religiosa</i>, from which it would appear that the statements of Fischer
  and others as to the number of moults are erroneous, owing to the earliest stages not having been
  observed. When the young <i>Mantis</i> emerges from the egg it bears little resemblance to the
  future Insect, but looks more like a tiny pupa; the front legs, that will afterwards become so
  remarkable, are short and not different from the others, and the head is in a curious mummy-like
  state, with the mouth-parts undeveloped and is inflexed on the breast: there are, he says, nine
  abdominal segments. The first ecdysis soon takes place and the creature is thereafter recognisable
  as a young <i>Mantis</i>. Pagenstecher's specimens at first would only eat Aphididae, but at a
  later stage of the <span class="pagenum" id="page248"><span
  class="smaller">{248}</span></span>development they devoured other Insects greedily: the number of
  ecdyses is seven or eight. The ocelli appear for the first time when the wing rudiments do so; the
  number of joints in the antennae increases at each moult. Dr. Pagenstecher considers that this
  Insect undergoes its chief metamorphosis immediately after leaving the egg, the earlier condition
  existing apparently to fit the Insect for escaping from the egg-case. In the immature stage of the
  Mantidae the alar organs appear (Fig. 139) as adjuncts of the sides of the meso- and meta-notum,
  projecting backwards and very deeply furrowed and ribbed in a wing-like manner. According to
  Pagenstecher, this wing-like appearance only commences in the fifth stadium, but he has not given
  particulars of the conditions of these parts in the preceding instars. According to de Saussure<a
  id="NtA_174" href="#Nt_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a> the wings of the females of some species remain
  permanently in this undeveloped or nymphal state.</p>

  <p>The Mantidae, as a rule, have a quiet unobtrusive mien, and were it not for their formidable
  front legs would look the picture of innocence; they, however, hold these legs in such manner as
  to greatly detract from the forbidding appearance thereof, stretching them out only partially so
  as to give rise to an appearance of supplication or prayer;<a id="NtA_175"
  href="#Nt_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a> this effect is increased by their holding themselves in a
  semi-erect position, standing on the hind and middle legs with the upper parts of the body
  directed somewhat forwards, hence they are called by various names indicating prayer or
  supplication, and it is said that in some countries they are considered sacred. Some of the older
  <span class="pagenum" id="page249"><span class="smaller">{249}</span></span>writers went so far as
  to say that a <i>Mantis</i> would indicate the road a child should take by stretching out one of
  its arms in the right direction. The traveller Burchell, speaking of a species since described by
  Westwood under the name of <i>Tarachodes lucubrans</i>, says: "I have become acquainted with a new
  species of <i>Mantis</i>, whose presence became afterwards sufficiently familiar to me by its
  never failing, on calm warm evenings, to pay me a visit as I was writing my journal, and sometimes
  to interrupt my lucubrations by putting out the lamp. All the <i>Mantis</i> tribe are very
  remarkable Insects; and this one, whose dusky sober colouring well suits the obscurity of night,
  is certainly so, by the very late hours it keeps. It often settled on my book, or on the press
  where I was writing, and remained still, as if considering some affair of importance, with an
  appearance of intelligence which had a wonderful effect in withholding my hand from doing it harm.
  Although hundreds have flown within my power, I never took more than five. I have given to this
  curious little creature the name of <i>Mantis lucubrans</i>; and having no doubt that he will
  introduce himself to every traveller who comes into this country [Southern Africa] in the months
  of November and December, I beg to recommend him as a harmless little companion, and entreat that
  kindness and mercy may be shown to him." This appearance of innocence and quietness must have
  struck all who have seen these Insects alive; nevertheless, it is of the most deceptive character,
  for the creature's activity consists of a series of wholesale massacres carried on day after day,
  the number of victims it sacrifices being enormous. The <i>Mantis</i> does not even spare its own
  kind; it is well known that the female not unfrequently devours its own mate. A very different
  picture to that of Burchell has been drawn by Potts, who observed the habits of a species in New
  Zealand.<a id="NtA_176" href="#Nt_176"><sup>[176]</sup></a> He informs us that when about making
  an attack it approaches its intended prey with slow, deliberate movements, its anterior limbs
  folded in an innocent fashion, now and then raising itself or lifting the prothorax in a stealthy
  quiet manner, perhaps to judge accurately of its distance; when near enough, with one swift dart
  the victim is secured. The prey is held <span class="pagenum" id="page250"><span
  class="smaller">{250}</span></span>firmly in the formidable trap formed by the anterior leg, and
  is thus brought near the mouth. The <i>Mantis</i> usually commences its feast by taking off some
  portions of the head of its wretched victim, and displays an absolute indifference to its
  struggling or kicking; the mandibles having seized a portion of the food, the legs holding it move
  away, thus leaving a fragment in the mouth. Portions only of a captured Insect are consumed, much
  being cast away; and Mr. Potts states that he has seen one of these voracious creatures kill and
  devour parts of fourteen small flies within a very brief space of time. This voracity and waste of
  animal food is very remarkable when we recollect that many Insects have such perfect powers of
  assimilation that during their whole period of growth they only consume a mass of food&mdash;and
  that vegetable&mdash;but little larger in size than the bulk they themselves attain. This fact is
  well known in the case of <i>Bruchus</i>, <i>Caryoborus</i>, and other seed-feeding Insects.
  Burmeister has stated good grounds for believing that some of the larger Mantidae do not confine
  themselves to Insect diet, but attack and devour small Vertebrates.<a id="NtA_177"
  href="#Nt_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a> He has given a circumstantial account of a case at Buenos
  Ayres, where a small bird was secured by the wingless female of a large <i>Mantis</i>, which had
  commenced devouring its head when the observer took possession of the creature and its booty.
  Dubois states<a id="NtA_178" href="#Nt_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a> that when a decapitated, but
  living, <i>Mantis</i> was suspending itself to a roll of drapery by its four posterior legs, a
  person could detach with the fingers the left anterior leg (of the four) and the right posterior,
  or conversely the left posterior and right anterior, without the interference producing any action
  on the part of the creature; but if one of the other legs was also interfered with, which would
  necessarily have changed the position of the body, then immediately one of the two unoccupied legs
  was placed by the creature in a proper position to assure its stability. This reflex action
  altogether resembled in appearance a conscious action, and was as effectually performed.</p>

  <p>The combination in Mantidae of voracious and destructive instincts with helpless and inert
  attitudes gives rise to the idea that these latter are adopted for the purpose of deceiving the
  living prey and of thus more easily obtaining the means of subsistence. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page251"><span class="smaller">{251}</span></span>It appears, however, more probable that the
  helpless attitudes have no such origin, but are due to the structure and form of the creature. The
  front legs being wonderfully well formed for raptorial purposes, have no capacity for locomotion
  or for supporting the Insect in the usual manner, so that the body has to be borne by the hinder
  two pairs of legs; at the same time the raptorial pair of limbs&mdash;which, it will be
  recollected, are of great size and attached to the anterior part of an unusually long
  prothorax&mdash;have to be held in such a position as will not derange the equilibrium maintained
  by the posterior part of the body; moreover, these large raptorial legs are entirely exserted, and
  have no trace of any articulatory cavity that might act as a mechanical aid to their support. Thus
  they could not be held extended without great muscular exhaustion; hence we can well believe that
  the sedentary and helpless attitudes of the creature are not the results of any guile.</p>

  <p>A <i>Mantis</i> has been recorded as bearing a close resemblance to a Phasmid of the genus
  <i>Bacillus</i> and having only small front legs; it was suggested by Bates<a id="NtA_179"
  href="#Nt_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a> that the Mantis would probably be found to feed on the
  <i>Bacillus</i>. Though the case is of considerable interest, no further information about it has

  <p>The simplest forms of the family are found in the groups Amorphoscelides and Orthoderides. From
  our figure of one of these (Fig. 141, <i>Mantoida luteola</i> &#x2642;), it will be seen that the
  peculiarities of the family can scarcely be detected, the raptorial legs being very little
  developed and the prothorax short. The sexes, too, differ but little in these simple forms. Most
  of them are very rare in collections, but Wood-Mason states<a id="NtA_180"
  href="#Nt_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a> that <i>Amorphoscelis annulicornis</i> is frequently found
  about Calcutta on the trunks of trees, to the bark of which it is so similar that it is only
  discovered with difficulty. In its rapid movements it resembles the cockroaches or
  <i>Machilis</i>, more than it does the more differentiated forms of its own group.</p>

  <p>In the genus <i>Pyrgomantis</i> (Fig. 142, <i>P. singularis</i>, female) the male has the
  tegmina and wings of normal size, while in the female they are rudimentary.</p>

  <p>The variety of shape and external appearance in this family is very great; de Saussure
  considers it to be a mimetic group. In certain species some parts of the body&mdash;more
  especially the tegmina&mdash;have very much the appearance of foliage, and usually in such cases
  this appearance is confined to the female, the males in this family having, as we have said, the
  organs of flight more transparent and colourless; in the former sex the alar organs, when present,
  are frequently but little adapted for flying. In some species the prothorax is expanded at the
  sides (Fig. 135, <i>Deroplatys sarawaca</i>; and Fig. 143, <i>Choeradodis cancellata</i>), and in
  such cases the outline of the natural thorax&mdash;if we may use such an expression&mdash;may be
  detected occupying the middle of the unusual expansion. The European <i>Mantis religiosa</i>
  varies much in colour; in some examples the tegmina are leaf-green, while in others they are brown
  or gray. There is some evidence extant making it probable that in some species the colour of an
  individual changes at different times&mdash;Colonel Bowker saying of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page253"><span class="smaller">{253}</span></span><i>Harpax ocellata</i> that it "beats the
  Chameleon hollow in changing colour."</p>

  <p>Some of the species of the old genus <i>Eremiaphila</i> (Fig. 144) are of very unusual form. De
  Saussure considers that some species of this genus are more highly modified than any other animals
  for maintaining their existence in desert regions. They are said to be found in places where no
  vegetation exists, and to assimilate in appearance with the sandy soil, the species varying in
  colour, so that the individuals agree in tint with the soil on which they dwell. These Insects are
  referred to the group Orthoderides, and have a short prothorax, the alar organs being unsuited for
  flight. What they live on is not actually known; although other Insects are the natural food of
  Mantids, it is said that these desert-frequenting species occur in spots where no other Insect
  life is known to exist. Lefebvre<a id="NtA_181" href="#Nt_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a> met with these
  Eremiaphilas in the desert between the Nile and the Northern Oasis, El Bahryeh, but was quite
  unable to discover their mode of subsistence. These Insects are very rare in collections, and the
  information we possess about them is very meagre.</p>

  <p>Mr. Graham Kerr found on the Pilcomayo river a species of Mantidae living on branches of trees
  amongst lichens, which it so exactly resembled that it was only detected by the movement of a
  limb; it was accompanied by a Phaneropterid grasshopper, which bore a similar resemblance to the
  lichens. One of the rarest and most remarkable forms of Mantidae is the genus <i>Toxodera</i>, in
  which the eyes project outwards as pointed cones (Fig. 145). These Insects offer an interesting
  problem for study, since we are entirely ignorant about them. Brunner places the Toxoderae in his
  tribe Harpagides, but with the remark that "these Insects of antediluvian shapes differ
  essentially from all other Mantidae."</p>

  <p>Wood-Mason informs us<a id="NtA_182" href="#Nt_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a> that the young of
  <i>Hymenopus bicornis</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page254"><span
  class="smaller">{254}</span></span>beautifully simulate blossoms of different colours. And it has
  been stated by Dr. Wallace, on the authority of a communication made to him by Sir Charles Dilke,
  that a small <i>Mantis</i> found in Java exactly resembles a pink Orchis-flower, and this species
  "was not only said to attract Insects, but even the kind of Insects (butterflies) which it allures
  and devours was mentioned." We do not know of what species or genus this Insect may be, but
  <i>Hymenopus bicornis</i> is a peculiar form of the tribe Harpagides, and has, together with its
  younger state, been figured long ago by Caspar Stoll in his quaint and interesting old book.<a
  id="NtA_183" href="#Nt_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a> Though it has very peculiar foliaceous expansions
  on the two hinder pairs of legs, these dilatations are very different from those seen in the
  curious <i>Gongylus gongylodes</i>, the female of which we figure (Fig. 146). This latter,
  according to the information we shall quote, is also a "floral simulator." Specimens of <i>G.
  gongylodes</i> were shown to the members of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1877 by Dr. J.
  Anderson,<a id="NtA_184" href="#Nt_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a> who at the same gave some information
  about them which we shall reproduce in full, because, incomplete as it is, it is apparently almost

  <p>"These Insects all came from the same locality, having been <span class="pagenum"
  id="page255"><span class="smaller">{255}</span></span>forwarded to Mr. Buckland by Mr. Larymore of
  the Central Jail at Midnapur. Mr. Larymore had procured them from the neighbouring country
  district, where Sant&aacute;l women and children had hunted them out and brought them in, hanging on
  branches or twigs of a bush, somewhat like a wild plum-tree. They are also said to be found upon
  rose-bushes, and in connexion with this it was observed that, in Midnapur, they were known as
  rose-leaf Insects, from the circumstance that when the Insect is more developed and furnished with
  wings, the foliaceous appendages are said greatly to increase in size, and exactly to resemble
  rose-leaves. Dr. Anderson, however, was disposed to think that more than one species might
  probably occur in the Midnapur district, and that these Insects with the larger foliaceous
  expansions might be distinct from the species now before the Society.</p>

  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page256"><span class="smaller">{256}</span></span></div>

  <p>"Mr. Buckland had made over these Insects to Dr. Anderson, and since that time they have been
  regularly fed upon house-flies and grasshoppers; the latter, however, appear to be rather too
  strong for them, and they therefore prefer the flies. They have been tried with small fragments of
  plaintain and custard-apple, which they not only eat, but the juice of which they seem to suck
  with considerable avidity, Dr. Anderson, however, thought that it was the moisture of these fruits
  that was the chief attraction to these Insects, for the entire character of their organisation
  indicated a raptorial habit.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Anderson went on to say that he had succeeded in identifying the three larger Insects by
  means of a single dried specimen in the Indian Museum, which, however, was fully mature and
  provided with wings. These remarkable Insects proved to be the pupae of a peculiar species of
  <i>Mantis</i> which was known to Aldrovandus, who figured it more than a century and a half before
  the first appearance of the Systema Naturae of Linnaeus, to whom it was known as <i>Gryllus
  gongylodes</i>, and also as <i>Mantis gongylodes</i>; and since the time of Aldrovandus it had
  been figured in a variety of works on Natural History, but apparently in every instance from
  mature, and seemingly dried specimens, so that the colours of the Insect during life had never
  been correctly described.</p>

  <p>"So much by way of introduction to these remarkable pupal Mantises, the recognised scientific
  name of which is <i>Gongylus gongylodes</i> L.</p>

  <p>"The reason which induced Dr. Anderson to bring them to the notice of the Society had now to be
  pointed out. On looking at the Insects from above, they did not exhibit any very striking features
  beyond the leaf-like expansion of the prothorax and the foliaceous appendages to the limbs, both
  of which, like the upper surface of the Insect, are coloured green, but on turning to the under
  surface the aspect is entirely different. The leaf-like expansion of the prothorax; instead of
  being green, is a clear, pale lavender-violet, with a faint pink bloom along the edges of the
  leaf, so that this portion of the Insect has the exact appearance of the corolla of a plant, a
  floral simulation which is perfected by the presence of a dark, blackish brown spot in the centre,
  over the prothorax, and which mimics the opening to the tube of a corolla. A favourite position of
  this Insect is to hang head <span class="pagenum" id="page257"><span
  class="smaller">{257}</span></span>downwards among a mass of green foliage, and, when it does so,
  it generally remains almost motionless, but, at intervals, evinces a swaying movement as of a
  flower touched by a gentle breeze; and while in this attitude, with its fore-limbs banded violet
  and black, and drawn up in front of the centre of the corolla, the simulation of a papilionaceous
  flower is complete. The object of the bright colouring of the under surface of the prothoracic
  expansion is evident, its purpose being to act as a decoy to Insects, which, mistaking it for a
  corolla, fly directly into the expectant, serrated, sabre-like, raptorial arms of the simulator.
  It is no new fact that many Insects resemble the leaves of plants and trees, and that they
  manifest forms and colours which serve to protect them in the struggle for existence, but so far
  as Dr. Anderson had ascertained, this was the first recorded instance of an Insect simulating the
  corolla of a flower for the evident purpose of attracting Insects towards it for its sustenance.
  It is even more remarkable than this, for it is a localised adaptation for such a purpose, a
  portion of the Insect being so modified in form and colour that the appearance of the corolla of a
  plant is produced, in conjunction with the remainder of the long attenuated prothorax, which at a
  distance resembles the flower stem; the anterior limbs when in repose even adding to and
  heightening the deception."</p>

  <p>That we should have no more precise information as to a large Insect of such remarkable habits
  and appearance, and one that has been known to naturalists for upwards of three centuries, is a
  matter for regret. Careful observation as to the habits, food, and variation of these floral
  simulators, and as to whether they seek for spots specially suitable to their coloration, would be
  of great interest. A European congener of this Insect, <i>Empusa pauperata</i>, has small
  foliaceous expansions on the legs, but its habits have not been noticed in detail.</p>

  <p>The very curious Insect represented in Fig. 147, <i>Stenophylla cornigera</i>, is a member of
  the tribe Vatides; the form of the cerci at the end of the body is very peculiar. This extremely
  rare, if not absolutely unique, Insect is a native of the interior of Brazil.</p>

  <p>Dufour has recorded that <i>Mantis religiosa</i> possesses the power of producing a mournful
  sound by rubbing the extremity of the body against the wings; it is stated that a hissing sound is
  <span class="pagenum" id="page258"><span class="smaller">{258}</span></span>produced by other
  species, and Wood-Mason has suggested<a id="NtA_185" href="#Nt_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a> that a
  special structure exists on the tegmina for the purpose.</p>

  <p>There are probably about 600 species of Mantidae known; they are distributed over all the
  warmer parts of the earth, but there are none in the cooler regions. Europe possesses some twelve
  or fourteen species, most of them confined to the Mediterranean sub-region; a single species,
  <i>Mantis religiosa</i>, is frequently found in Central France, and has been recorded as occurring
  as far north as Havre. Although no species is a native of Britain, it is not difficult to keep
  them alive here. Denny records<a id="NtA_186" href="#Nt_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> that an egg-case
  of a <i>Mantis</i> was sent from Australia to England, and that the hatching of the eggs was
  completed after its arrival. The young fed readily on flies, and we are informed that in the
  neighbourhood of Melbourne, where this <i>Mantis</i> is plentiful, specimens are placed by the
  citizens on the window-blinds of their houses, so that the rooms may be cleared from flies by
  means of the indefatigable voracity of the <i>Mantis</i>.</p>

  <p>The geological record as to Mantidae is very meagre and unsatisfactory. The genus <i>Mantis</i>
  is said to occur in amber, and Heer has referred to the same genus an ill-preserved fossil from
  the upper Miocene beds of Central Europe; a fragment <span class="pagenum" id="page259"><span
  class="smaller">{259}</span></span>of a hind wing found in the Jurassic strata of Siberia has been
  assigned to the family; and until recently <i>Lithomantis</i> from the Carboniferous beds of
  Scotland was considered to belong to Mantidae. Scudder, however, has rejected it therefrom,
  placing it in the Neuropteroid division of Palaeodictyoptera, and Brongniart, adding another
  species to the genus from the Carboniferous strata in France, proposed to treat the two as a
  distinct family, which he called Palaeomantidae.<a id="NtA_187"
  href="#Nt_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a> This naturalist has, however, since renewed his study<a
  id="NtA_188" href="#Nt_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a> of these Insects, has become convinced that they
  have no relations with existing Mantidae, and has consequently removed them to the family
  Platypterides in the Order Neuroptera.</p>

  <p>Six tribes of Mantidae are recognised by Brunner and de Saussure.</p>

  <p>These Insects are amongst the most curious of natural objects. They are frequently of large
  size, some attaining 9 inches in length (Fig. 162, <i>Palophus centaurus</i>, one-half natural
  length). Their variety of form could scarcely be surpassed; their resemblance to products of the
  vegetable kingdom is frequently very great: some of the more linear species (Fig. 148,
  <i>Lonchodes nematodes</i>) look like sticks or stems of grass; some have a moss-like appearance,
  while others resemble pieces of lichen-covered bark. The members of the tribe Phylliides are
  leaf-like. A certain number of other Phasmids are covered with strong spines, like thorns (Fig.
  149). The plant-like appearance is greatest in the female sex. When there is a difference between
  the two sexes as to the organs of flight, these are more fully developed in the male.</p>

  <p>The antennae are usually many-jointed, but the number of joints varies from 8 to more than 100;
  the head is exserted; the eyes are more or less prominent; ocelli are present in some cases. The
  prothorax is always small, and it is a remarkable fact that it undergoes but little elongation
  even in those species that are most linear and elongate in form (see Fig. 148, <i>Lonchodes
  nematodes</i>), and that have the meso- and metathoraces extremely long; it is very simple in
  structure, consisting apparently merely of a dorsal and of a sternal plate, nearly the whole of
  the side being occupied by the large space in which the coxae are inserted; the edges of the
  pronotum are not free. The mesothorax is frequently six times as long as the prothorax, though in
  the leaf-like and a few other forms it does not possess this great extension; still it is always
  of large size relatively to the other two thoracic segments. This is peculiar inasmuch as in other
  groups where the mesothorax is relatively large there are powerful mesothoracic wings; whereas the
  Phasmidae are remarkable for the obsolescence of the mesothoracic alar appendages. The middle legs
  and the tegmina or elytra, when present, are attached only to the posterior part of the
  mesothorax; the notum and the sternum are separated by two narrow slips on each side, the epimeron
  and episternum. The metathorax is formed like the mesothorax, except that the posterior part of
  the dorsal surface is considered to consist of the first ventral segment consolidated with the
  posterior part of the metanotum, the two being distinct enough in the winged forms. The hind body
  or abdomen is elongated except in the Phylliides; it consists of ten dorsal plates; the first
  frequently looks like a portion of the metanotum, and is treated as really such by Westwood, who
  describes the abdomen as consisting of nine segments. The flat apical appendages are attached
  behind the tenth dorsal plate. The ventral plates are similar to the dorsal in arrangement, except
  that in the female the eighth plate forms a sort of spoon-like or gutter-like process to assist in
  carrying or depositing the eggs, and that the two following segments are concealed by it, and are
  sometimes of more delicate texture. The legs vary greatly in the details of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page262"><span class="smaller">{262}</span></span>their shape: the coxae are short, oval, or
  round, never large; the trochanter is small; the front femora often have the basal part narrower
  than the apical, and they are frequently so formed that they can be stretched out in front of the
  head, concealing its sides and outline and entirely encasing the antennae. There is an arolium or
  cushion between the claws of the five-jointed tarsi. The front legs are frequently longer than the
  others. Only a very slight study has been made of the alar organs of Phasmidae; but according to
  Redtenbacher and Brauer, they differ greatly from those of Blattidae and Mantidae, inasmuch as the
  costal vein is placed not on the actual margin of the wing but in the field thereof, and in this
  respect they more resemble the Orthoptera saltatoria.</p>

  <p>Very little information exists as to the internal anatomy of the Phasmidae. Many years ago a
  memoir of a fragmentary and discursive nature was published on the subject by J. M&uuml;ller,<a
  id="NtA_189" href="#Nt_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a> but his conclusions require confirmation; the
  nervous system, according to his account, which refers to <i>Arumatia ferula</i>, has the anterior
  ganglia small, the supra-oesophageal ganglion being apparently not larger than those forming the
  ventral chain.</p>

  <p>When the young Insect is in the egg, ready for emergence, the meso- and meta-thorax are not
  remarkably elongate, so that the femora are not very far apart, but by the time the creature has
  fairly emerged from the prison of its embryonic life the thoracic segments have attained their
  usual proportions; much expansion of the body takes place as the Insect leaves the egg, so that it
  appears a marvel how it could have been contained therein; this expansion affects the parts of the
  body unequally.</p>

  <p>The records as to the post-embryonic development of Phasmidae are very scanty, but indicate
  great differences in the length of time occupied by it. <i>Bacillus patellifer</i> is said to
  moult several times, <i>Diapheromera femorata</i> only twice. This latter species becomes full
  grown in six weeks, while, according to Murray,<a id="NtA_191" href="#Nt_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a>
  <i>Phyllium scythe</i> required fifteen or sixteen months for growth, and did not moult until ten
  months after hatching; the number of ecdyses in the case of the <i>Phyllium</i> was three. At each
  change of skin an immediate increase in size, similar to that we have noticed as occurring on
  leaving the egg, takes place; each limb on being freed becoming about a fourth longer and larger
  than the corresponding part of the envelope from which it has just been withdrawn. After the
  second moult of <i>Phyllium</i> the tegmina and wings made their appearance, but remained of very
  <span class="pagenum" id="page264"><span class="smaller">{264}</span></span>small size until after
  the third moult, when they suddenly shot out to their full size; they came out of little cases
  about a quarter of an inch long, and in the course of a few minutes attained their full size of
  about two and a half inches of length. In the apterous species the difference between the young
  and adults in external characters is very slight.</p>

  <p>Phasmidae are very sensitive to cold; both in North America and Australia their lives are
  terminated by the occurrence of frost. They are all vegetable feeders, the cannibalism that has
  been attributed to them by several writers being probably imaginary. They are, however,
  excessively voracious, so that a pair will destroy a great quantity of foliage; they are
  consequently in some parts of the world classed amongst injurious Insects. In Fiji and the
  Friendly Islands, <i>Lopaphus cocophagus</i> eats the cocoa-nut foliage and causes a scarcity of
  food, so that it becomes a matter of necessity to destroy these Insects. One writer has gone so
  far as to attribute the occurrence of cannibal habits amongst the inhabitants of some of these
  islands to the want of food caused by the ravages of this Insect. Some, if not all, of the
  Phasmidae have the habit of ejecting a stinking fluid, that is said to be very acrid, and
  occasionally, when it strikes the eye, to cause blindness; this liquid comes from glands placed in
  the thorax. Some Phasmidae are much relished as food by birds; <i>Diapheromera femorata</i> is
  sucked by several bugs as well as eaten by birds, and another species is recorded to have
  harboured Ichneumon-flies in its body without suffering any apparent inconvenience from their
  presence or from their emergence. Notwithstanding the great amount of food they consume and their
  want of activity, they produce comparatively few eggs. From twelve to twenty or thirty is
  frequently mentioned as about the <span class="pagenum" id="page265"><span
  class="smaller">{265}</span></span>number, but in the case of <i>Diapheromera femorata</i> Riley
  speaks of upwards of one hundred. These eggs are not deposited in any careful way, but are
  discharged at random, simply dropping from the female; the noise caused by the dropping of the
  eggs of <i>Diapheromera femorata</i> from the trees on which the Insects are feeding to the ground
  is said to resemble the pattering of raindrops. The eggs of this species often remain till the
  second year before they hatch. The eggs in the Phasmidae generally are of a most remarkable
  nature, and nearly every one who mentions them speaks of their extreme resemblance to seeds.
  G&ouml;ldi<a id="NtA_192" href="#Nt_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a> has suggested that this is for the
  purpose of deceiving Ichneumons; it is, however, on record that the eggs are actually destroyed by
  Ichneumons. It is worthy of notice that the eggs are shed like seeds, being dropped loosely and,
  as we have said, remaining on the ground or elsewhere, sometimes for nearly two years, without
  other protection than that they derive from their coverings. Each egg is really a capsule
  containing an egg, reminding us thus of the capsule of the Blattidae, which contains, however,
  always a number of eggs. Not only do the eggs have a history like that of seeds, and resemble them
  in appearance, but their capsule in minute structure, as we shall subsequently show, greatly
  resembles vegetable tissue. The egg-capsule in Phasmidae is provided with a lid, which is pushed
  off when the Insect emerges (Fig. 157). This capsule induced Murray to suppose that the egg
  contained within is really a pupa, and he argued therefrom that in the Orthoptera the larval
  stages are passed in the egg, and that the Insect after its emergence should be looked on as an
  active pupa that takes food.</p>

  <p>The individuals of this group of Insects possess the power of reproducing a lost limb; and
  Scudder, who has made some experiments as to this,<a id="NtA_193"
  href="#Nt_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a> states that if a leg be cut off beyond the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page266"><span class="smaller">{266}</span></span>trochantero-femoral
  articulation, the parts remaining outside of this joint are dropped before the next moult, and are
  afterwards renewed either as a straight short stump in which the articulations are already
  observable, or as a miniature leg, the femur of which is straight and the tibia and tarsus curved
  into a nearly complete circle; in the former case, the leg assumes at the next moult the
  appearance that it has in the second case; this latter form is always changed at the succeeding
  moult into a leg resembling the normal limb in every respect excepting size, and the absence of
  the fourth tarsal joint (Fig. 153). If the leg be removed nearer to the body than the
  trochantero-femoral articulation the limb is not replaced.</p>

  <p>The sexes are frequently extremely different; the female is usually very much larger than the
  male. This latter sex often possesses wings when they are quite wanting in the other sex; the
  resemblance to portions of plants is often very much greater in the female than it is in the
  male.</p>

  <p>We have pointed out that the tegmina or upper wings are usually of small size or absent (Fig.
  150, <i>Aschipasma catadromus</i>), even in the species where the lower wings are very largely
  developed; in such cases the latter organs are folded in a complicated, fan-like manner, and
  repose on the back, looking as if they were really the tegmina (Fig. 159, <i>Calvisia
  atrosignata</i>); this appearance, moreover, is in some species enhanced much by the fact that the
  part of the wing which is outermost in the folded state is quite differently <span class="pagenum"
  id="page267"><span class="smaller">{267}</span></span>coloured from the rest of the organ. The
  colour of the body in many Phasmidae is said to be very variable, and if the tints be owing to
  chlorophyll or other plant juices, finding their way amongst the Insect-tissues, this is readily
  understood; in <i>Diapheromera</i> the young Insect is brownish on hatching, becomes green after
  feeding, and turns brown again when the leaves do so. The ocelli, too, are said to be very
  variable, and M&lsquo;Coy goes so far as to state<a id="NtA_194"
  href="#Nt_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a> that they may be either present or absent in different
  individuals though of the same species and sex,&mdash;a statement so remarkable as to require
  minute examination, though it is to some extent confirmed by the remarks of other
  entomologists.</p>

  <p>The resemblance presented by different kinds of Orthoptera to leaves is so remarkable that it
  has attracted attention even in countries where Natural History is almost totally neglected; in
  many such places the inhabitants are firmly convinced that the Insects are truly transformed
  leaves, by which they understand a bud developing into a leaf and subsequently becoming a
  walking-leaf or Insect. To them the change is a kind of metamorphosis of habit; it grew as a leaf
  and then took to walking.<a id="NtA_195" href="#Nt_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a> It is usually the
  tegmina that display this great resemblance to vegetable structures, and there is perhaps no case
  in which the phenomenon is more marked than it is in the genus <i>Phyllium</i>, the members of
  which occur only in the tropical regions of the Old World, where they extend from Mauritius and
  the Seychelles to the Fiji Islands&mdash;possibly even more to the East&mdash;and have, it would

  </div>

  <p>The genus <i>Phyllium</i> constitutes by itself the tribe Phylliides. Although the characters
  and affinities of this group have been only very inadequately investigated, it will probably prove
  to be a very distinct and isolated one. The species are not well known, but are probably numerous,
  and the individuals are believed not to be rare, though the collections of entomologists are very
  badly supplied with them. The resemblance of the tegmina or front wings to leaves is certainly of
  the most remarkable nature. During the early life the Insect does not possess the tegmina, but it
  is said then to adapt itself to the appearance of the leaves it lives on, by the positions it
  assumes and the movements<a id="NtA_196" href="#Nt_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a> it makes. When
  freshly hatched it is of a reddish-yellow colour. The colour varies at different periods of the
  life, but "always more or less resembles a leaf." After the young Insect has commenced eating the
  leaves it speedily becomes bright green; and when the metamorphosis is completed the female Insect
  is possessed of the leaf-like tegmina shown in Figs. 154, 156. Before its death the specimen
  described by Murray passed "through the different hues of a decaying leaf." Brongniart has had
  opportunities of observing one of these leaf-Insects, and has, with the aid of M. Becquerel,
  submitted their colouring matter to spectral analysis,<a id="NtA_197"
  href="#Nt_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a> with the result of finding <span class="pagenum"
  id="page269"><span class="smaller">{269}</span></span>that the spectrum exhibits slight
  distinctions from that of solutions of chlorophyll, but does not differ from that of living
  leaves. Mr. J. J. Lister when in the Seychelles brought away living specimens of <i>Phyllium</i>;
  and these becoming short of food, nibbled pieces out of one another just as they might have done
  out of leaves. The Phasmidae are purely vegetable feeders, and these specimens did not seriously
  injure one another, but confined their depredations to the leaf-like appendages and
  expansions.</p>

  <p>The males of this genus are totally different from the females; the foliaceous tegmina being
  replaced by appendages that are not leaf-like, while the posterior wings, which are large and
  conspicuous parts of the body, have no leaf-like appearance (Fig. 155).</p>

  <p>In the female <i>Phyllium</i> the hind wings are not present, being represented by a minute
  process (Fig. 156, B). The tegmen of the female <i>Phyllium</i> is, from various points of view, a
  remarkable and exceptional structure. It is the rule that when there is in Insects a difference
  between the alar organs of the two sexes it is the male that has them largest; this is the case in
  <i>Phyllium</i> so far as the hind wings are concerned, but in the fore-wings the rule is departed
  from, the leaf-like tegmina of the female being very much larger than the rudimentary wing-covers
  of the male. In Phasmidae it is the rule that the tegmina are atrophied, even when the hind wings
  are largely developed. This is the case in the male of <i>Phyllium</i>, but in the female this
  normal condition is reversed. Although the alar organs of Phasmidae have received hitherto but a
  small amount of attention, it is probable that the female tegmen of <i>Phyllium</i> is as peculiar
  morphologically as it is in other respects. In Fig. 156 we give an accurate representation of the
  chief nervures in the tegmen of a female <i>P. crurifolium</i>. It is interesting to compare this
  with the diagrams we give of the tegmina of a Blattid (Fig. 121) and of an Acridiid <span
  class="pagenum" id="page270"><span class="smaller">{270}</span></span>(Fig. 167); the tegmen of
  the <i>Phyllium</i> is very different, the radial vein and all the parts behind it being placed
  quite close to the posterior edge of the structure. A similar view is taken by both Redtenbacher
  and Brauer. The latter says,<a id="NtA_198" href="#Nt_198"><sup>[198]</sup></a> "In
  <i>Phyllium</i> (the walking-leaf) almost the whole of the front wing is formed by the praecostal
  and subcostal fields; all the other fields with their nervures, including even the costa, are
  compressed towards the hind margin into a slender stripe. In the hind wing the costa is, however,
  marginal." Unfortunately no examination appears to have been made of the male tegmen, so that we
  do not know whether that of the female differs from it morphologically as strongly as it does
  anatomically. It is, however, clear that the tegmina of the female <i>Phyllium</i> not only
  violate a rule that is almost universal in the Insecta, but also depart widely from the same parts
  of its mate, and are totally different&mdash;and, for a Phasmid, in an almost if not quite unique
  fashion&mdash;from the other pair of alar organs of its own body.</p>

  <p>We have already alluded to the resemblance to seeds displayed by the eggs of Phasmidae. The
  eggs of <i>Phyllium</i> have been studied by several entomologists, and their resemblance to seeds
  excites general astonishment. Murray describes the egg-capsule of <i>Phyllium scythe</i>, and
  says: "It looks uncommonly like some seeds; if the edges of the seed of <i>Mirabilis jalapa</i>
  were rubbed off, the seed might be mistaken for the egg. The ribs are all placed at equal
  distances, except two, which are wider apart, and the space between them flatter, so that on the
  egg falling it rolls over till it comes to this flatter side, and there lies.... At the top there
  is a little conical lid, fitting very tightly to the mouth.... On removing the lid we see a
  beautiful porcelain chamber of a pale French-white colour, bearing a close resemblance to the
  texture of a hen's egg, but it is not calcareous, and has more the appearance of enamel." The eggs
  of <i>P. crurifolium</i> have been examined by Joly and Henneguy; their account confirms that of
  Murray. Henneguy adds that a prominent lozenge on the egg represents the surface by which the
  achene of an umbelliferous plant is united to the column, and that the micropyles are placed on
  this lozenge. The minute structure of the capsule has also been examined by several entomologists;
  and Henneguy,<a id="NtA_199" href="#Nt_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a> who has described and figured
  some of the details of the capsule of <i>P. crurifolium</i>, says, "Almost every botanist, on
  examining for <span class="pagenum" id="page272"><span class="smaller">{272}</span></span>the
  first time a section of this capsule, would declare that he is looking at a vegetable
  preparation."</p>

  <p>We may remark that, although there is difference of opinion on the point, the evidence extant
  goes to show that the egg-capsules are formed in the egg-tubes, only one egg being produced at a
  time in a tube,<a id="NtA_200" href="#Nt_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a> the others in it remaining
  quite rudimentary.</p>

  <p>About 600 species of the family are known; there are only four or five kinds found in Europe,
  and they are all confined to the south, only one of them extending as far north as Central France.
  The males of these European <i>Bacilli</i> are extremely rare in comparison with the females,
  which are common Insects. Phasmidae are of almost universal distribution in the warm parts of the
  world, and even the species whose individuals are of large size seem to be able to continue their
  existence in comparatively small islands. Australia is perhaps the region where they are most
  largely developed at present. Macleay says of <i>Podacanthus wilkinsoni</i> that it is rare in any
  part of Australia to find in the summer season a gum-tree without a few of these Insects grazing
  on it; and occasionally this Insect has been so abundant there that the trees for miles around
  have been denuded of their foliage by it, and the dead and dying Insects have been found lying
  beneath the trees almost in heaps. There are several Phasmidae in New Zealand, all wingless forms,
  and different from those found in Australia. In Brazil a species of the genus <i>Prisopus</i> has
  the peculiar habit of seeking shelter under the stones submerged in the mountain streams; to
  enable it to do this it is remarkably constructed, the under side of the body being hollowed, and
  various parts set with a dense fringe of hairs; the Insect is supposed to expel the air from the
  body in order to adhere to the upper surface of a stone, where it sits with its fore legs extended
  in front of its head, which is directed against the current. Attention has been called to a still
  more remarkable form said to be allied to the Prisopi, by Wood-Mason,<a id="NtA_201"
  href="#Nt_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a> who calls the Insect <i>Cotylosoma dipneusticum</i>. This
  Insect is apparently known only by a single example of the female sex; it is 3 or 4 inches in
  length, has rudimentary organs of flight, and along the lower margins of the metathorax there are
  said to be on each side five <span class="pagenum" id="page273"><span
  class="smaller">{273}</span></span>conspicuous fringed plates of the nature of tracheal gills;
  these coexist with open stigmata for aerial respiration, as in the imago of <i>Pteronarcys</i>.
  The writer has examined this curious Insect, and thinks it very doubtful whether the plates are
  branchiae at all. The locality for this Insect is the island of Taviuni, not Borneo, as stated by
  Wood-Mason. These and one or two Acridiidae are the only Insects of the Order Orthoptera at
  present believed to possess aquatic habits.</p>

  <p>Some Insects said to belong to the genera <i>Phasma</i> and <i>Bacteria</i> have been found in
  amber. A single Insect-fossil found in the Tertiary strata in North America has recently been
  referred by Scudder to the family, and even to a genus still existing in the New
  World&mdash;<i>Agathemera</i>; the fragment is, however, so defective, and the characteristic
  points of the Phasmidae are so little evident in it, that not much reliance can be placed on the
  determination. No Phasmid has been unearthed from Mesozoic strata, so that, with the exception of
  the fragment just mentioned, nothing that evidently belongs to the Phasmidae has been discovered
  older than the remains preserved in amber. In the Carboniferous layers of the Palaeozoic epoch
  there are found remains of gigantic Insects that may possibly be connected with our living
  Phasmidae. These fossils have been treated by Brongniart and Scudder as forming a distinct family
  called Protophasmidae. The first of these authors says<a id="NtA_203"
  href="#Nt_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a> that our Phasmidae were represented in the Carboniferous <span
  class="pagenum" id="page277"><span class="smaller">{277}</span></span>epoch by analogous types
  differing in the nature of the organs of flight: these ancient Insects were of larger size than
  their descendants, being 25 to 50 centimetres long, and as much as 70 in spread of wing. To this
  group are referred, on somewhat too inferential grounds, the fossil wings found in the
  Carboniferous layers, and called by Goldenberg <i>Dictyoneura</i>.</p>

  <p>We reproduce from Zittel's handbook a figure (Fig. 162) of one of these gigantic Insects, and
  add an attempt at a restoration of the same after the fashion of Scudder (Fig. 163). From these
  figures it will be seen that the relation to our existing Phasmidae must at best have been very
  remote.<a id="NtA_204" href="#Nt_204"><sup>[204]</sup></a> It will be noted that the larger of the
  two figures is on a &#x2155; scale.</p>

  <p>The classification of Phasmidae was left in a very involved state by St&aring;l, but has recently
  been brought into a more satisfactory condition by Brunner von Wattenwyl. We give a translation of
  his table of the tribal characters<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>We commence the consideration of the saltatorial Orthoptera with the family Acridiidae. It
  includes the grasshoppers of our native fields as well as the destructive migratory locusts of
  foreign countries, and is the most numerous in species and individuals of any of the Orthopterous
  families. Our native grasshoppers, though of small size, give a very good idea of the Acridiidae.
  Active little Insects, with large head, conspicuous <span class="pagenum" id="page280"><span
  class="smaller">{280}</span></span>eyes, laterally somewhat compressed body, long hind legs with
  femur directed upwards and backwards, the knee-joint forming an acute angle, the organs of flight
  pressed to the sides of the body, our common grasshoppers represent the Acridiidae quite as truly
  as do the gigantic exotic forms, some of which measure 9 or 10 inches across the expanded
  wings.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The large head is immersed behind in the thorax; the front is deflexed, or even inflexed, so as
  to be placed in a plane at an acute angle with that of the vertex (Fig. 165); the compound eyes
  are placed at the sides of the head and rather widely separated; in front there are three small
  ocelli. Two of these are placed one on each side close to the eye between the eye and the base of
  the antenna; the third ocellus being in the middle just in front of the insertion of the antennae,
  between the edges of the margined space that usually runs down the middle of the front. The
  positions of these ocelli and the shape of the front and upper parts of the head are of importance
  in the classification of the family; the ocelli vary much in their development, being in some
  species beautifully clear and prominent (Fig. 166), while in others they are small, not easily
  detected, apparently functionally imperfect. The antennae are never very long, are sometimes
  compressed and pendent from the front of the head. The parts of the mouth are very large. The
  prothorax is much arched; it is often carinate or crested along the middle of the notum; this part
  is frequently prolonged backwards, forming a sort of hood over the base of the wings; the surface
  may be rugged or warty, forming in some species inexplicable structures; the legs are widely
  separated, all of them being placed at the sides of the body; the edge of the pronotum is distinct
  and situate close to the base of the leg; the prosternum frequently bears a large projection
  extending directly downwards between the front legs. The mesothorax is short, its chief sternal
  piece is very broad, the middle legs being very widely separated. The metathorax is larger; its
  sternal plate usually exhibits behind a sort of embrasure filled up by a portion of the first
  ventral plate.</p>

  <p>The hind body is elongate, and shows distinctly eight dorsal segments, behind which are the
  pieces forming&mdash;in the female, the fossorial organs which replace an ovipositor&mdash;in the
  male, the modified parts connected with the terminal segment. The alar organs (Fig. 167) exhibit,
  according to Brunner, the same areas as we have described in Blattidae. According, however, to
  Redtenbacher<a id="NtA_210" href="#Nt_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a> the tegmina of the Acridiidae and
  other saltatorial Orthoptera differ from those of the cursorial group (with the exception of the
  Phasmidae) in that they possess a praecostal field, due to the fact that the vein which in the
  Cursoria is costal, <i>i.e.</i> forms the front margin, in the Saltatoria lies, on the contrary,
  in the field of the wing. If this view be correct the mediastinal area of Brunner is not
  homologous in the two divisions. The tegmina are long and comparatively narrow; they are of firm
  parchment-like texture, with several longitudinal veins, which divide beyond the middle, so as to
  become more numerous as they reach the extremity of the wing; there is much reticulation, dividing
  the surface into numerous small cells. The hind wings are much more ample, and of more delicate
  texture; the longitudinal veins fork but little, the numerous cross veinlets are fine. In repose
  the hind wings fold together in a fan-like manner, and are entirely concealed by the upper wings.
  The front and middle legs are similar and small, the coxae are quite small, and do not completely
  fill the articular cavities, which are partly covered by membrane; all the tarsi are
  three-jointed. The basal joint, when looked at beneath, is seen to bear three successively placed
  pads, so that from beneath the tarsi look as if they were five-jointed <span class="pagenum"
  id="page282"><span class="smaller">{282}</span></span>(Fig. 185, C). The hind legs are
  occasionally very long; their femora, thicker towards the base, are generally peculiarly
  sculptured, bearing longitudinal ridges or grooves, which are more or less spinose, and are also
  very frequently marked with short parallel lines meeting a central longitudinal line at similar
  angles, so as to give rise to a well-marked pattern; where the legs are broader the pattern is
  more complex (Fig. 168). The long tibiae bear two rows of spines on their upper or posterior edge;
  this part of the hind leg can be completely bent in under the femur. The stigmata consist of one
  prothoracic, one metathoracic, and eight abdominal pairs.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In reference to the ocelli, which are shown in Fig. 166, we may remark that the Acridiidae is
  one of the large groups of Insects in which the coexistence of compound and single eyes is most
  constant, though in some of the wingless forms the ocelli are very imperfect. We know at present
  of nothing in the habits of Acridiidae to render two kinds of eyes specially necessary. We shall
  subsequently see that a similar condition in regard to the function of hearing is believed to
  exist in this family.</p>

  <p>Acridiidae are remarkable amongst the Orthoptera for the possession of air sacs or vesicular
  dilatations in the interior of the Insect in connexion with the tracheae (Fig. 176). Such vesicles
  are found in many of the higher winged Insects, but not in larval forms, or in those that are
  destitute of powers of flight.<a id="NtA_211" href="#Nt_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a> They, no doubt,
  assist the Insect in its movements in the air. The body of a large grasshopper or locust is
  naturally of considerable weight, and it is more than probable that true flight can only be
  accomplished when these vesicles are dilated and filled with air. The exact mode in which the sacs
  are dilated is not known; possibly it may be accomplished by the elasticity of the structure of
  the vesicles coming into action when the other contents of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page283"><span class="smaller">{283}</span></span>body are not completely developed, or are
  temporarily diminished. Although air vessels are absent in the neighbouring groups of Orthoptera,
  Dufour says they are present even in apterous forms of Acridiidae, but he gives no particulars.<a
  id="NtA_212" href="#Nt_212"><sup>[212]</sup></a> Packard has given an account<a id="NtA_213"
  href="#Nt_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a> of the arrangement of these remarkable sacs in the Rocky
  Mountain Locust. He finds that there are two sets: a thoracic group, consisting of a pair of very
  large size, with which are connected some smaller sacs placed in the head; and an abdominal set,
  which forms a very remarkable series. The figures we give (Fig. 176, A, B) show that these sacs
  are of such large size that if fully distended they must interfere with the development of the
  ovaries, and that they must be themselves greatly diminished, if not obliterated, by the
  distension of the alimentary canal. We may look on them as only coming into full play when the
  normal distension of the canal is prevented, and there is only small development of the
  reproductive organs. Under such circumstances the locust becomes a sort of balloon, and migrates.
  In addition to the air sacs there are many dilatable tracheae, placed chiefly in parts of the body
  where there is not space for the large air sacs. These are, for the sake of clearness, omitted
  from our figure.</p>

  <p>The ganglia constituting the brain are simpler in Acridiidae than they are in the higher
  Insects, such as bees and wasps, and have been specially studied by Packard<a id="NtA_214"
  href="#Nt_214"><sup>[214]</sup></a> and Viallanes.<a id="NtA_215"
  href="#Nt_215"><sup>[215]</sup></a> The other ganglia of the nervous cord are eight in number,
  three thoracic and five abdominal.</p>

  <p>The salivary glands are small. The alimentary canal is capacious but not coiled. It has no

  is united in a single envelope. The form and arrangement of the ovaries is remarkable (Fig. 169);
  the egg-tubes are united by the convergence of their terminal threads into a single mass; outside
  of each ovary there extends a large calyx, into which the tubes open; each calyx is prolonged at
  its extremity, and forms a long, convoluted tube.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Acridiidae possess structures for the production of sound, together with others that are, no
  doubt, for hearing. The chirping of grasshoppers is accomplished by rubbing together the outer
  face of the upper wing and the inner face of the hind femur. This latter part bears a series of
  small bead-like prominences placed on the upper of the two lower ridges that run along the side
  that is nearest to the body (Fig. 170); the tegmen or wing-case has projecting veins, one of which
  is slightly more prominent, and has a sharp edge; by scraping this edge over the beads of the
  femur the wing is thrown into a state of vibration and a musical sound is produced. The apparatus
  for producing sound was for long supposed to be confined to the male sex of grasshoppers; it was
  indeed known that females made the movements appropriate for producing music, but as they appeared
  to be destitute of instruments, and as no sound was known to follow from their efforts, it was
  concluded that these were merely imitative. Graber has, however, discovered<a id="NtA_216"
  href="#Nt_216"><sup>[216]</sup></a> that rudimentary musical organs do exist in the females of
  various species of <i>Stenobothrus</i> (Fig. 171, B). It is true that in comparison with those of
  the male (Fig. 171, A) they are minute, but it would appear that they are really phonetic, though
  we can hear no sounds resulting from their use.</p>

  <p>Graber considers that the musical pegs of Acridiidae are <span class="pagenum"

  certain females the stages intermediate between hair and peg can be found. There is apparently
  much variety in the structure of these instruments in different species, and even in individuals
  of the same species. In <i>Stenobothrus lineatus</i>, instead of pegs, the instrument consists of
  raised folds.</p>

  <p>In some of the aberrant forms of Acridiidae&mdash;certain Eremobiides and Pneumorides&mdash;the

  </div>

  <p>If the dorsal aspect of the first segment of the hind body of an Acridian Insect be carefully
  examined there may be seen in the majority of species an organ which has somewhat the appearance
  of an ear (Fig. 172), and which there is great reason for believing to be really an organ of that
  nature. It is situate a little over the articulation of the hind leg, very close to the spot where
  the sound is, as above described, produced. There are three forms of these Acridian ears as
  described by Brunner:<a id="NtA_217" href="#Nt_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a> (1) a membrane surrounded
  by a rim; (2) the membrane somewhat depressed, a portion of the segment projecting a little over
  it; (3) the depression very strongly marked, and the sides projecting over it so much that all
  that is seen externally is a sort of broad slit with a cavity beneath it. This last is the
  condition in which the ear exists in the genera <i>Mecostethus</i> (Fig. 173) and
  <i>Stenobothrus</i>, which are among our few native grasshoppers. On minute examination this ear
  proves to consist of a tympanum supplied internally with nerve and ganglion in addition to <span
  class="pagenum" id="page286"><span class="smaller">{286}</span></span>muscles, and tracheal
  apparatus of a complex nature; it is no doubt delicately sensitive to some forms of vibration.
  Unlike the stridulating organ, these ears exist in both sexes; they are found in a great majority
  of the species of Acridiidae. The forms in which the ears are absent are usually at the same time
  wingless and destitute of organs of stridulation; but, on the other hand, there are
  species&mdash;some of them wingless&mdash;that are, so far as is known, incapable of stridulation
  and yet possess these ears.</p>

  <p>It is, indeed, a matter of great difficulty to decide as to the exact function of these
  ear-like acoustic organs, which, we may remind the reader, are peculiar to the saltatorial
  Orthoptera, and we must refer for a full discussion of the subject to Graber's masterly works,<a
  id="NtA_218" href="#Nt_218"><sup>[218]</sup></a> contenting ourselves with a brief outline, which
  we may commence by saying that the Orthoptera with ears are believed to be sensitive to sounds by
  means other than these organs. This suggests that the latter exist for some purpose of perception
  of special sound. But if so what can this be? Only the males possess, so far as we know, effective
  sound-producing organs, but both sexes have the special ears; moreover, these structures are
  present in numerous species where we do not know of the existence of phonetic organs in either
  sex. Thus it appears at present impossible to accept these organs as being certainly special
  structures for the perception of the music of the species. It is generally thought that the
  females are charmed by the music of the males, and that these are stimulated to rivalry by the
  production of the sounds; and Dufour<a id="NtA_219" href="#Nt_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a> has
  suggested that this process reacts on the physiological processes of the individual. There has not
  been a sufficient amount of observation to justify us in accepting these views, and they do not in
  any way dispose of the difficulty arising from the existence of the acoustic organs in species
  that do not, so far as we know, produce special sounds. It is possible that the solution of the
  difficulty may be found in the fact that these apparently dumb species do really produce some
  sound, though we are quite ignorant as to their doing so. It is well known that sounds inaudible
  to some human ears are perfectly distinct to others. Tyndall, in his work on Sound, has
  illustrated this by a fact that is of special interest from our present point of view. "Crossing
  <span class="pagenum" id="page287"><span class="smaller">{287}</span></span>the Wengern Alp with a
  friend," he says, "the grass on each side of the path swarmed with Insects which to me rent the
  air with their shrill chirruping. My friend heard nothing of this, the Insect world lying beyond
  his limit of audition." If human ears are so different in their capacities for perceiving
  vibrations, it of course becomes more probable that auditory organs so differently constituted as
  are those of Insects from our own may hear sounds when the best human ear can detect nothing
  audible. On the whole, therefore, it would appear most probable that the Orthoptera provided with
  acoustic organs, and which we consider dumb, are not really so, but produce sounds we cannot hear,
  and do so in some manner unknown to us. If this be the case it is probable that these ears are
  special organs for hearing particular sounds.</p>

  <p>Scudder, who has given considerable attention to the subject of Orthopteran music, says that in
  N. America "the uniformity with which each species of <i>Stenobothrus</i> plays its own song is
  quite remarkable. One kind, <i>Stenobothrus curtipennis</i>, produces about six notes per second,
  and continues them from one and a half to two and a half seconds; another, <i>S.
  melanopleurus</i>, makes from nine to twelve notes in about three seconds. In both cases the notes
  follow each other uniformly, and are slower in the shade than in the sun."</p>

  <p>Some of the species of Acridiidae, it should be noticed, produce a noise during their flights
  through the air, due to the friction of the wings; whether this has a definite importance, or
  whether it may be entirely incidental, has scarcely yet been considered.</p>

  <p>Information of a satisfactory kind as to the post-embryonic development of the Acridiidae is
  but scanty. We have represented in Fig. 84, A, the condition in which a migratory locust,
  <i>Schistocerca peregrina</i>, leaves the egg, and we will here complete the account of its
  growth; following Brongniart,<a id="NtA_220" href="#Nt_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a> whose statement
  is confirmed by Lestage and other naturalists. Immediately on leaving the egg the young locust
  casts its skin, and is then of a clear green colour, but it rapidly becomes brown, and in twelve
  hours is black. At this early age the gregarious instinct, possessed by this and some other
  species of Acridiidae, becomes evident. In six days the individual undergoes a second moult, after
  which it is black, spotted and banded with white, and with a rose-coloured streak on each side of
  the hind body. The <span class="pagenum" id="page288"><span
  class="smaller">{288}</span></span>third ecdysis occurs in six or eight days after the second; the
  rose colour becomes more distinct, and the head is of a brown tint instead of black. After eight
  days the fourth ecdysis occurs; the creature is then about 35 millim&egrave;tres long; its colour has
  much changed, the position of the markings is the same, but the rose colour is replaced by citron
  yellow, the line of the spiracles is marked with white, and at this time the creature has the
  "first rudiments of wings," and is very voracious. In ten days another ecdysis takes place, the
  yellow colour is more vivid, the prothorax is definitely speckled with white, and the hind body is
  increasing much in size. In fifteen or twenty days the sixth moult occurs, and the Insect appears
  in its perfect form; the large tegmina now present are marked with black in the manner so well
  known, and the surface generally is variegated with bluish and rosy marks. Although this is the
  colour in Algeria, yet apparently it is not so farther south; the Insects that arrive thence in
  the French colony are on some occasions of a different colour, viz. reddish or yellowish, those of
  this latter tint being, it is believed, older specimens of the reddish kind. M. Brongniart points
  out that some Phasmidae&mdash;of the <i>Phyllium</i> group&mdash;undergo an analogous series of
  colour-changes in the course of the individual development, though other species do not.</p>

  <p>Riley and Packard have given an account<a id="NtA_221" href="#Nt_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a> of
  some parts of the post-embryonic development of the Rocky Mountain Locust, which enables us to
  form a satisfactory conception of the stages of development of the wings. Fig. 175, A, represents
  the first instar, the young locust, just emerged from the egg and colourless. Fig. 174 shows some
  of the subsequent stages of development of the wings, the upper line of figures giving a profile
  view of the thoracic segments, and the lower line showing their dorsal aspects; 1 shows the
  condition of the parts in the second instar, the chief difference from the first instar being the
  development of colour; in the third instar there is an evident slight development of the future
  alar organs, exhibited chiefly in the outgrowth and lobing of the free posterior angles of the
  meso- and metanota, as shown in Fig. 174, 2. After the third moult there is a great difference;
  the instar then disclosed&mdash;the fourth&mdash;has undergone a considerable change in the
  position of the meso- and metathoraces, which are thrust forward under the pronotum; this has
  become more enlarged and hood-like (Fig. 174, 3); at the same time the wing-rudiments have become
  free and detached, the metathoracic pair being the larger, and overlapping the other pair. The
  fifth instar (Fig. 174, 4) differs but little from the fourth, except in the larger size of the
  pronotum and wing-rudiments. The sixth&mdash;shown in Fig. 175, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page290"><span class="smaller">{290}</span></span>B&mdash;is the perfect Insect, with the alar
  organs free and large, the prothorax much changed in form, the colour different. From the above it
  will be seen that the chief changes occurred at the third and fifth ecdyses, after each of which a
  considerable difference in the form of the Insect was revealed. In the first three instars the
  sexes can scarcely be distinguished, in the fourth they are quite distinct, and in the fifth
  coupling is possible, though usually it does not occur till the final stage is attained.</p>

  <p>The discovery that Orthoptera change their colours in the course of their development, and even
  after they have become adult, is important, not only from a physiological point of view, but
  because it throws some light on the questions as to the number of species and the geographical
  distribution of the migratory locusts, as to which there has existed a great confusion.</p>

  <p>The Acridiidae are considered to be exclusively vegetable feeders, each individual consuming a
  very large quantity of food. The mode in which the female deposits her eggs has been described by
  Riley,<a id="NtA_222" href="#Nt_222"><sup>[222]</sup></a> and is now widely known, his figures
  having been frequently reproduced. The female has no elongate ovipositor, but possesses instead
  some hard gonapophyses suitable for digging purposes; with these she excavates a hole in the
  ground, and then deposits the eggs, together with a quantity of fluid, in the hole. She prefers
  hard and compact soil to that which is loose, and when the operation is completed but little trace
  is left of it. The fluid deposited with the eggs hardens and forms a protection to them,
  corresponding to the more definite capsules of the cursorial Orthoptera.</p>

  <p>The details of the process of oviposition and of the escape of the young from their
  imprisonment are of much interest. According to K&uuml;nckel d'Herculais<a id="NtA_223"
  href="#Nt_223"><sup>[223]</sup></a> the young <i>Stauronotus maroccanus</i> escapes from the
  capsule by putting into action an ampulla formed by the membrane between the head and the thorax;
  this ampulla is supposed to be dilated by fluid from the body cavity, and is maintained in the
  swollen condition by the Insect accumulating air in the crop beneath it. In order to dislodge the
  lid of the capsule, six or seven of the young ones inside combine their efforts to push it off by
  means of their ampullae. The ampulla <span class="pagenum" id="page291"><span
  class="smaller">{291}</span></span>subsequently serves as a sort of reservoir, by the aid of which
  the Insect can diminish other parts of the body, and after emergence from the capsule, penetrate
  cracks in the earth so as to reach the surface. Immediately after doing this the young
  <i>Stauronotus</i> moults, the skin it casts being called by K&uuml;nckel an amnios. The cervical
  ampulla reappears at subsequent moults, and enables the Insect to burst its skin and emerge from
  it.</p>

  <p>The process is apparently different in <i>Caloptenus spretus</i>, which, according to Riley,
  ruptures the egg-shell and works its way out by the action of the spines at the apex of the
  tibiae. This latter Insect when it emerges moults a pellicle, which Riley considers to be part of
  the embryonic membranes.</p>

  <p>Riley states that a female of <i>Caloptenus spretus</i> makes several egg-masses. Its period of
  ovipositing extends over about 62 days, the number of egg-masses being four and the total number
  of eggs deposited about 100. The French naturalists have recently observed a similar fact in
  Algeria, and have ascertained that one of the migratory locusts&mdash;<i>Schistocerca
  peregrina</i>&mdash;may make a deposit of eggs at more than one of the places it may alight on
  during its migration.</p>

  <p>It has been ascertained that the eggs of Acridiidae are very nutritious and afford sustenance
  to a number of Insects, some of which indeed appear to find in them their sole means of
  subsistence. Beetles of the family Cantharidae frequent the localities where the eggs are laid and
  deposit their eggs in the egg-masses of the Orthoptera, which may thus be entirely devoured.
  Two-winged flies of the family Bombyliidae also avail themselves of these eggs for food, and a
  mite is said to be very destructive to them in North America. Besides being thus destroyed in
  enormous quantities by Insects, they are eaten by various birds and by some mammals.</p>

  <p>Most of the Insects called locusts in popular language are members of the family Acridiidae, of
  which there are in different parts of the world very many species, probably 2000 being already
  known. To only a few of these can the term Locust be correctly applied. A locust is a species of
  grasshopper that occasionally increases greatly in number, and that moves about in swarms to seek
  fresh food. There are many Orthoptera that occasionally greatly increase in numbers, and that then
  extend their usual area more or less; and some Acridiidae multiply <span class="pagenum"
  id="page292"><span class="smaller">{292}</span></span>locally to a great extent&mdash;very often
  for one or two seasons only,&mdash;and are then called locusts. The true migratory locusts are
  species that have gregarious habits strongly developed, and that move over considerable distances
  in swarms. Of these there are but few species, although we hear of their swarms in many parts of
  the world.</p>

  <p>The migratory locusts do much more damage than the endemic species. In countries that are
  liable to their visitations they have a great influence on the prosperity of the inhabitants, for
  they appear suddenly on a spot in huge swarms, which, in the space of a few hours, clear off all
  the vegetable food that can be eaten, leaving no green thing for beast or man. It is difficult for
  those who have not witnessed a serious invasion to realise the magnitude of the event. Large
  swarms consist of an almost incalculable number of individuals. A writer in <i>Nature</i><a
  id="NtA_224" href="#Nt_224"><sup>[224]</sup></a> states that a flight of locusts that passed over
  the Red Sea in November 1889 was 2000 square miles in extent, and he estimated its weight at
  42,850 millions of tons, each locust weighing <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span
  class="suu">16</span> of an ounce. A second similar, perhaps even larger, flight was seen passing
  in the same direction the next day. That such an estimate may be no exaggeration is rendered
  probable by other testimony. From official accounts of locusts in Cyprus we find that in 1881,<a
  id="NtA_225" href="#Nt_225"><sup>[225]</sup></a> up to the end of October, 1,600,000,000 egg-cases
  had been that season collected and destroyed, each case containing a considerable number of eggs.
  By the end of the season the weight of the eggs collected and made away with amounted to over 1300
  tons, and, notwithstanding this, no less than 5,076,000,000 egg-cases were, it is believed,
  deposited in the island in 1883.</p>

  <p>When we realise the enormous number of individuals of which a large swarm of locusts may
  consist we can see that famine is only a too probable sequence, and that pestilence may
  follow&mdash;as it often has done&mdash;from the decomposition of the bodies of the dead Insects.
  This latter result is said to have occurred on some occasions from locusts flying in a mass into
  the sea, and their dead bodies being afterwards washed ashore.</p>

  <p>Locust swarms do not visit the districts that are subject to their invasions every year, but,
  as a rule, only after intervals of a considerable number of years. It has been satisfactorily
  <span class="pagenum" id="page293"><span class="smaller">{293}</span></span>ascertained that in
  both Algeria and North America large swarms occur usually only at considerable intervals. In North
  America Riley thought<a id="NtA_226" href="#Nt_226"><sup>[226]</sup></a> the average period was
  about eleven years. In Algeria the first invasion that occurred after the occupation of the
  country by the French was in 1845, the second in 1864, the third in 1866, since which 1874 and
  1891 have been years of invasion. These breaks seem at first strange, for it would be supposed
  that as locusts have great powers of increase, when once they were established in any spot in
  large numbers, there would be a constant production of superfluous individuals which would have to
  migrate as regularly as is the case with swarms of bees. The irregularity seems to depend on three
  facts: viz. that the increase of locusts is kept in check by parasitic Insects; that the eggs may
  remain more than one year in the ground and yet hatch out when a favourable season occurs; and
  that the migratory instinct is only effective when great numbers of superfluous individuals are
  produced.</p>

  <p>It is not known that the parasites have any power of remaining in abeyance as the locust eggs
  may do; and the bird destroyers of the locusts may greatly diminish in numbers during a year when
  the Insects are not numerous; so that a disproportion of numbers between the locusts and their
  destroyers may arise, and for a time the locusts may increase rapidly, while the parasites are
  much inferior to them in numbers. If there should come a year when very few of the locusts hatch,
  then the next year there will be very few parasites, and if there should then be a large hatching
  of locusts from eggs that have remained in abeyance, the parasites will not be present in
  sufficient quantity to keep the destructive Insects in check; consequently the next year the
  increase in number of the locusts may be so great as to give rise to a swarm.</p>

  <p>It is well established that locusts of the migratory species exist in countries without giving
  rise to swarms, or causing any serious injuries; thus <i>Pachytylus cinerascens</i>&mdash;perhaps
  the most important of the migratory locusts&mdash;is always present in various localities in
  Belgium, and does not give rise to swarms. When migration of locusts does occur it is attended by
  remarkable manifestations of instinct. Although several generations may elapse without a
  migration, it is believed that the locusts when <span class="pagenum" id="page294"><span
  class="smaller">{294}</span></span>they migrate do so in the direction taken by predecessors.
  Their movements are to a large extent dependent on the wind, and it is said that they make trial
  flights to ascertain its direction. When on the wing probably very little muscular effort is
  necessary. Their bodies contain elastic air sacs in communication with the tracheae, and at the
  time of flight it may be presumed that the body is comparatively empty, food being wanting, and
  the internal organs of reproduction, which occupy a large space when in activity, yet undeveloped,
  hence the sacs have full room for expansion, as explained on <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page283">283</a></span>. Thus the Insects exert but little effort in their aerial
  movements, and are, it is believed, chiefly borne by the wind. Should this become unfavourable it
  is said that they alight and wait for a change.</p>

  <p>The most obscure point in the natural history of the migratory locusts appears to be their
  disappearance from a spot they have invaded. A swarm will alight on a locality, deposit there a
  number of eggs, and then move on. But after a lapse of a season or two there will be few or none
  of the species present in the spot invaded. This appears to be partly due to the young locusts
  dying for want of food after hatching; but in other cases they again migrate after growth to the
  land of their ancestors. The latter fact is most remarkable, but it has been ascertained by the
  U.S. Entomological Commission that these return swarms do occur.</p>

  <p>In South Africa it would appear that the movements of the migratory locusts are frequently made
  before the Insects have acquired their wings. Mrs. Barber, in an account of "Locusts and
  Locust-Birds in South Africa,"<a id="NtA_227" href="#Nt_227"><sup>[227]</sup></a> has illustrated
  many points in the <span class="pagenum" id="page295"><span
  class="smaller">{295}</span></span>Natural History of these Insects. The South African species
  manifests the gregarious and migratory disposition when the individuals are quite young, so that
  they travel in flocks on foot, and are called by the Dutch "Voetgangers." After hatching, the
  various families of young amalgamate, so that enormous numbers come together. Having denuded the
  neighbourhood of all its food-supplies, they move off in search of fresh crops and pastures new.
  They take advantage of roads, and sometimes a good many miles will be traversed in a day; they
  proceed by means of short leaps, rapidly repeated. When the "Voetgangers" are thus returning
  northwards towards the lands in the interior from which their progenitors departed, no obstacles
  can stay their course. Forests or rivers may intervene, diverting them for a while from their line
  of march, but they succeed ultimately in continuing their journey to the interior.</p>

  <p>The manner in which these wingless locusts occasionally cross broad rivers is interesting, as
  it has some bearing on the difficult question of the possibility of winged locusts crossing seas
  of considerable width. Mrs. Barber refers to an instance that took place on the Vaal River in the
  spring of the year 1871, shortly after the discovery of the Diamond-fields. The country was at
  that time swarming with young locusts; every blade of grass was cleared off by them. One day a
  vast swarm of the "Voetgangers" made their appearance on the banks of the Vaal River; they
  appeared to be in search of a spot for crossing, which they could not find, the river being
  somewhat swollen. For several days the locusts travelled up the stream; in the course of doing
  this they paused for some time at an abrupt bend in the river where a number of rocks were
  cropping out, as if in doubt whether to attempt a passage at this place. They, however, passed on,
  as if with the hope of finding a better ford; in this apparently they were disappointed, for three
  days afterwards they returned to the same bend of the river, and there plunged in vast multitudes
  into the stream, where, assisted by a favourable current and the sedges and water-plants which
  grew upon the projecting rocks, they managed to effect a crossing, though great numbers were
  drowned and carried away by the flooded river. Mrs. Barber adds that "Voetgangers" have been known
  to attempt the passage of the Orange River when it was several hundred yards in breadth, pouring
  their vast swarms into the flooded stream regardless of the consequences, until they <span
  class="pagenum" id="page296"><span class="smaller">{296}</span></span>became heaped upon each
  other in large bodies. As the living mass in the water accumulated, some portions of it were swept
  away by the strong current from the bank to which they were clinging, and as the living locusts
  tightly grasped each other and held together, they became floating islands, the individuals
  continually hopping and creeping over each other as they drifted away. Whether any of the
  locust-islands succeeded in reaching the opposite bank is unknown; probably some of them were
  drifted on land again. They are by no means rapid swimmers; they do not perish easily in the water
  when in masses, their habit of continually changing places and hopping and creeping round and
  round upon each other being very advantageous as a means of preservation. It is a common practice
  for the young locusts to form a bridge over a moderately broad stream by plunging indiscriminately
  into it and holding on to each other, grappling like drowning men at sticks or straws, or, in
  fact, anything that comes within their reach, and that will assist in floating them; meanwhile
  those from behind are eagerly pushing forward over the bodies of those that are already in the
  stream and hurrying on to the front, until at length by this process they reach the opposite bank
  of the river; thus a floating mass of living locusts is stretched across the stream, forming a
  bridge over which the whole swarm passes. In this manner few, comparatively speaking, are drowned,
  because the same individuals do not remain in the water during the whole of the time occupied by
  the swarm in crossing, the Insects continually changing places with each other; those that are
  beneath are endeavouring to reach the surface by climbing over others, whilst those above them
  are, in their turn, being forced below. Locusts are exceedingly tenacious of life, remaining under
  water for a considerable time without injury. An apparently drowned locust will revive beneath the
  warm rays of the sun, if by chance it reaches the bank or is cast on shore. Mrs. Barber relates an
  interesting case where the instinct of the "Voetgangers" was at fault, they plunging into a river
  from a steep sandy bank, only to find another similar sandy precipice on the other side. On this
  they could gain no footing, and all perished in the stream, where they putrefied, and caused the
  death of the fish, which floated likewise on the surface; so powerful were the effluvia produced
  that no one was able to approach the river.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page297"><span class="smaller">{297}</span></span></div>

  <p>Locusts are able to travel considerable distances, though how far is quite uncertain. Accounts
  vary as to their moving by night. It has, however, been recently proved that they do travel at
  night, but it is not ascertained how long they can remain in the air without descending. The ocean
  is undoubtedly a source of destruction to many swarms; nevertheless, they traverse seas of
  considerable width. They have been known to reach the Balearic Islands, and Scudder gives<a
  id="NtA_228" href="#Nt_228"><sup>[228]</sup></a> a well-authenticated case of the occurrence of a
  swarm at sea. On the 2nd of November 1865 a ship on the voyage from Bordeaux to Boston, when 1200
  miles from the nearest land, was invaded by a swarm of locusts, the air and the sails of the ship
  being filled with them for two days. The species proved to be <i>Acridium</i>
  (<i>Schistocerca</i>) <i>peregrinum</i>. This is an extraordinary case, for locusts do not fly
  with rapidity, being, indeed, as we have remarked, chiefly carried by the wind. Possibly some
  species may occasionally rest on the water at night, proceeding somewhat after the fashion of the
  "Voetgangers" when passing over rivers as described by Mrs. Barber. In Sir Hans Sloane's history
  of Jamaica an account of an occurrence of this kind is given on the authority of Colonel Needham,
  who states that in 1649 locusts devastated the island of Tenerife, that they were seen to come
  from Africa when the wind was blowing thence, that they flew as far as they could, then alighted
  on the water, one on the other, till they made a heap as big as the greatest ship, and that the
  next day, being refreshed by the sun, they took flight again and landed in clouds at Tenerife. De
  Saussure says<a id="NtA_229" href="#Nt_229"><sup>[229]</sup></a> that the great oceans are, as a
  rule, impassable barriers, and that not a species of the tribe Oedipodides has passed from the Old
  World to the New. It is, however, possible that <i>Acridium peregrinum</i>, of the tribe
  Acridiides, may have originally been an inhabitant of America, and have passed from thence to the
  Old World.</p>

  hemisphere, extending from the Atlantic Ocean to China. It exists in numerous spots in the
  Oriental region and the Asiatic Archipelago, and even in New Zealand. It is the commoner of the
  locusts of Europe. Its congener, <i>P. migratorius</i>, is much less widely distributed, its
  migrations being, according to de Saussure, limited to Turkestan and Eastern Europe. A third
  species, <i>P. migratorioides</i>, inhabits Eastern Africa, and a variety of it is the "Yolala" or
  locust of Madagascar. Mr. Distant has informed the writer that this migratory locust is found in
  South Africa. <i>P.</i> (<i>Oedaleus</i>) <i>marmoratus</i> has almost as wide a distribution in
  the Eastern hemisphere as <i>P. cinerascens</i>, except that it is more exclusively tropical; it
  is thus excluded from New Zealand. <i>P.</i> (<i>Oedaleus</i>) <i>nigrofasciatus</i> has a more
  northern distribution than its congener, but has extended to Africa and the Asiatic Archipelago.
  This Insect is so variable that the distinctions of its races from other species of the same genus
  are not yet clear. All the above-mentioned locusts belong to the tribe Oedipodides. <i>Acridium
  peregrinum</i>, now more frequently called <i>Schistocerca peregrina</i>, belongs to the tribe
  Acridiides. It is a large locust (Fig. 84), and has a wide distribution. It is the chief species
  in North Africa, and is probably the locust of the plagues of Egypt mentioned in the book of
  Exodus. It is also, according to Cotes,<a id="NtA_231" href="#Nt_231"><sup>[231]</sup></a> the
  chief locust of North-West India. In this latter country <i>Pachytylus cinerascens</i> and some
  other species also occur. With the exception of <i>S. peregrina</i>, the species of the genus
  <i>Schistocerca</i> are confined to the New World. In North America locusts are more usually
  called grasshoppers. Several species of the genus <i>Caloptenus</i> are injurious in that country,
  but the chief migratory species is <i>C. spretus</i> (Fig. 175). This genus belongs to Acridiides.
  A large locust, <i>Schistocerca americana</i>, is also migratory to a small extent in the United
  States. In South America other species of <i>Schistocerca</i> are migratory; it is not known how
  many there may be, and it is possible that one or more may prove to be the <i>S. peregrina</i> of
  the Old World. A Chilian species, according to Mr. E. C. Reed,<a id="NtA_232"
  href="#Nt_232"><sup>[232]</sup></a> <span class="pagenum" id="page299"><span
  class="smaller">{299}</span></span>exhibits distinctions of colour similar to those that have been
  observed in <i>S. peregrina</i> in Algeria.</p>

  <p>In Britain we are now exempt from the ravages of locusts, though swarms are said to have
  visited England in 1693 and 1748. Individuals of the migratory species are, however, still
  occasionally met with in England and the south of Scotland. <i>P. cinerascens</i> has been
  recorded from Kerry in Ireland, but erroneously, the Insect found being <i>Mecostethus grossus</i>
  (Fig. 173). According to Miss Ormerod,<a id="NtA_233" href="#Nt_233"><sup>[233]</sup></a> large
  locusts are imported to this country in fodder in considerable numbers, but are usually dead;
  living individuals are, however, sometimes found among the others. In 1869 living specimens of
  <i>Schistocerca peregrina</i> were found in various parts of the country, having, in all
  probability, arrived here by crossing the German Ocean. <i>Pachytylus cinerascens</i> has also, it
  is believed, occurred here, the specimens that have been recorded at different times under the
  name of <i>P. migratorius</i> being more probably the former species.</p>

  <p>Although the majority of the very large number of species included in Acridiidae are recognised
  with ease from their family likeness as belonging to the group, yet there are others that present
  an unusual aspect. This is specially the case with the members of the small tribes Tettigides,
  Proscopides, and Pneumorides, and with some of the apterous forms of the Oedipodides. The tribe
  Proscopides (Fig. 178, <i>Cephalocoema lineata</i>, female) includes some of the most curious of
  the Acridiidae. Breitenbach gives<a id="NtA_234" href="#Nt_234"><sup>[234]</sup></a> a brief
  account of the habits of certain species which he met with near Porto Alegre in South America. On
  a stony hill there was some grass which, by several months' exposure to the sun's rays, had <span
  class="pagenum" id="page300"><span class="smaller">{300}</span></span>become withered and brown.
  Apparently no live thing was to seen on this hillock except the ubiquitous ants, but after a while
  he noticed some "lightning-like" movements, which he found were due to specimens of Proscopia. The
  Insects exactly resemble the withered vegetation amongst which they sit, and when alarmed seek
  safety with a lengthy and most rapid leap. When attention was thus directed to them he found the
  Insects were really abundant, and was often able to secure fifty specimens on a single afternoon.
  These Insects bear a great general resemblance to the Phasmides, but there is no evidence at
  present to show that the two kinds of Insects live in company, as is the case with so many of the
  Insects that resemble one another in appearance. Although the linear form and the elongation of
  the body are common to the stick-Insects and the Proscopides, yet this structure is due to the
  growth of different parts in the two families. In the Phasmidae the prothorax is small, the
  mesothorax elongate, while in the Proscopides the reverse is the case. The elongation of the head
  is very curious in these Insects; the mouth is not thus brought any nearer to the front, but is
  placed on the under side of the head, quite close to the thorax. The tribe Tryxalides contains
  Insects (Fig. 165) that approach the Proscopides in the form of the head and other characters. In
  most cases the sexes of the Proscopides differ from one another so strongly that it is difficult
  to recognise them as being of the same species. Usually both sexes are entirely apterous, but the
  Chilian genus <i>Astroma</i> exhibits a remarkable exception and an almost unique condition of the
  alar organs, the mesonotum being in each sex entirely destitute of such appendages, while the
  female has on the metanotum rudiments of wings which are absent in the male.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The tribe Tettigides is a very extensive group of small Acridiidae, in which the pronotum
  extends backwards as a hood and covers the body, the tegmina and wings being more or less
  modified. In our British species (Fig. 179) this condition does not greatly modify the appearance
  of the Insect, but in many exotic species (Fig. 180) the hood assumes <span class="pagenum"
  id="page301"><span class="smaller">{301}</span></span>remarkable developments, so that the Insects
  have no longer the appearance of Orthoptera. It would be impossible, without the aid of many
  figures, to give an idea of the variety of forms assumed by this prothoracic expansion. It is a
  repetition of what occurs in the Order Hemiptera, where the prothoracic hoods of the Membracides
  exhibit a similar, though even more extraordinary, series of monstrous forms. So great is the
  general similarity of the two groups that when the genus <i>Xerophyllum</i> (Fig. 180, A) was for
  the first time described, it was treated by the describer as being a bug instead of a grasshopper.
  This genus includes several species from Africa. The curious <i>Cladonotus</i> (Fig. 180, B) is a
  native of Ceylon, where it is said to live in sandy meadows, after the fashion of our indigenous
  species of <i>Tettix</i> (Fig. 179). Very little is known as to the habits of these curious
  Tettigides, but it has been ascertained that some of the genus <i>Scelimena</i> are amphibious,
  and do not hesitate to enter the water and swim about there; indeed it is said that they prefer
  plants growing under water as food. This habit has been observed both in Ceylon and the Himalayas.
  The species are said to have the hind legs provided with dilated foliaceous appendages useful for
  swimming.</p>

  <p>The tribe Mastacides includes thirty or forty species of Acridiidae with short antennae and
  vertical head (Fig. 181, <i>Mastax guttatus</i>); they are apparently all rare and little <span
  class="pagenum" id="page302"><span class="smaller">{302}</span></span>known, but are widely
  distributed in the tropics of the Old and New Worlds. Nothing whatever seems to be known of their
  habits or of their development.</p>

  <p>The tribe Pneumorides includes a still smaller number of species of very aberrant and
  remarkable grasshoppers, of large size, with short antennae, and with the pronotum prolonged and
  hood-like; they are peculiar to South Africa. Although amongst the most remarkable of Insects, we
  are not able to give any information as to their habits. It would appear from the form of their
  legs that they have but little power of hopping. The species of which we figure the female (Fig.
  182) is very remarkable from the difference in colour of the sexes. The female is so extravagantly
  coloured that she has been said to look as if "got up" for a fancy-dress ball. She is of a gay
  green, with pearly white marks, each of which is surrounded by an edging of magenta; the white
  marks are very numerous, especially on the parts of the body not shown in our figure; the face has
  magenta patches and a large number of tiny pearly-white tubercles, each of which, when placed on a
  green part, is surrounded by a little ring of mauve colour. Though the female is certainly one of
  the most remarkably coloured of Insects, her consort is of a modest, almost unadorned green
  colour, and is considerably different in form. He is, however, provided with a musical apparatus,
  which it is possible may be a means of pleasing his gorgeous but dumb spouse. It consists of a
  series of ridges placed on each side of the inflated abdomen, which, as we have previously (<span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page200">200</a></span>) remarked, has every appearance of being inflated
  with the result of improving its resonance.</p>

  <p>The Pyrgomorphides<a id="NtA_235" href="#Nt_235"><sup>[235]</sup></a> is a small tribe of about
  120 described species, two of which are found in the south of Europe (Fig. 183, <i>Pyrgomorpha
  grylloides</i>). The tribe includes a number of large and curious Insects, among them the species
  of <i>Phymateus</i> and <i>Petasia</i>, with peculiar excrescences on the pronotum and vivid
  colours on some parts of the body or its appendages, which are apparently common Insects in South
  Africa.</p>

  <p>The tribe Tryxalides includes a great many species of grasshoppers. In them the front of the
  head joins the upper part at an acute angle (Figs. 165 and 173). This tribe and the Acridiides are
  the most numerous in species of the family. To the latter belong most of the migratory locusts of
  the New World (Fig. 175, <i>Caloptenus spretus</i>). A Spanish species of this tribe,
  <i>Euprepocnemis plorans</i>, though provided with well-developed wings, possesses the remarkable
  habit of seeking shelter by jumping into the water and attaching itself below the surface to the
  stems of plants.</p>

  <p>The tribe Pamphagides<a id="NtA_236" href="#Nt_236"><sup>[236]</sup></a> includes some 200
  species, found chiefly in Africa and the arid regions near the Mediterranean Sea. They are mostly
  apterous forms, and this circumstance has, according to de Saussure, exercised a marked influence
  on the geographical distribution of the species. Although the tribe consists chiefly of apterous
  forms, several species possess <span class="pagenum" id="page304"><span
  class="smaller">{304}</span></span>well-developed wings; sometimes this is the case of the male
  but not of the female. Some of the species are highly modified for a desert life, and exhibit a
  great variation in the colour of the individuals in conformity with the tint of the soil they
  inhabit. <i>Xiphocera asina</i> (Fig. 184) is thought by P&eacute;ringuey to be the prey of the
  extraordinary South African tiger-beetles of the genus <i>Manticora</i>.</p>

  <p>We have already mentioned the tribe Oedipodides<a id="NtA_237"
  href="#Nt_237"><sup>[237]</sup></a> as including most of the species of migratory locusts of the
  Old World. Some striking cases of variation in colour occur amongst the winged Oedipodides. In
  certain species the hind wings may be either blue or rosaceous in colour; it is thought that the
  latter is the tint natural in the species, and that it is due to the mixture of a red pigment with
  the pale blue colour of the wing; hence the blue-coloured wings are analogous to cases of
  albinism. But the most remarkable fact is that this colour difference is correlative with
  locality. Brunner von Wattenwyl says<a id="NtA_238" href="#Nt_238"><sup>[238]</sup></a> that the
  blue variety of <i>Oe. variabilis</i> occurs only in a few localities in Europe&mdash;he mentions
  Vienna and Sarepta,&mdash;and that where it occurs not a single red example can be met with.
  Similar phenomena occur in other species in both Europe and North America, and L. Bruner has
  suggested<a id="NtA_239" href="#Nt_239"><sup>[239]</sup></a> that the phenomena in the latter
  country are correlative with climatic conditions.</p>

  <p>The group Eremobiens, a subdivision of Oedipodides, includes some of the most interesting forms
  of Acridiidae. Its members have several modes of stridulation. <i>Cuculligera flexuosa</i> and
  other of the winged forms, according to Pantel,<a id="NtA_240" href="#Nt_240"><sup>[240]</sup></a>
  produce sounds by the friction of the middle tibia against the wing, both of these parts being
  specially modified for the purpose in the male sex. The most peculiar members of the Eremobiens
  are some very large Insects, modified to an extraordinary extent for a sedentary life in deserts
  and arid places. Trimen says<a id="NtA_241" href="#Nt_241"><sup>[241]</sup></a> that a South
  African species, <i>Trachypetra bufo</i>, which lives amongst stones, is so coloured that he had
  much difficulty in detecting it, and that he noticed in certain spots, often only a few square
  yards in extent, where the stones lying on the ground were darker, lighter, or more mottled than
  usual, that the individuals of the grasshopper were of a similar colour to the stones.</p>

  <p>The Insect referred to by Trimen is, we believe, the <i>Batrachotettix whiti</i> of de

  hood that protects the base of the hind body. Some of the desert Eremobiens vary so much that the
  differences found among individuals of the same species <span class="pagenum" id="page306"><span

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Methone anderssoni</i>, an inhabitant of the Karoo Desert of South Africa, is one of the
  largest of the Acridiidae. A female of this species is represented of the natural size in Fig.
  185. This Insect is remarkable on account of the complex organs for producing sound, and for the
  great modification of the posterior legs (Fig. 185, <i>b</i>), which do not possess locomotive
  functions, but serve as a portion of the sound-producing apparatus, and as organs for protecting
  the sides of the body. This Insect is said to be very efficient in making a noise. The sexes
  differ considerably in their sound-producing organs, a portion of which are present in the female
  as well as in the male (Fig. 186). Connected with the first abdominal segment, but extending
  backwards on the second, there is a peculiar swelling bearing two or three strongly raised
  chitinous folds (Fig. 186, <i>c</i>). When the leg is rotated these folds are struck by some
  peg-like projections situate on the inner face of the base of the femur, and a considerable noise
  is thus produced. The pegs cannot be seen in our figure. This apparatus is equally well developed
  in female and male. On the second abdominal segment, immediately behind the creaking folds we have
  described, there is a prominent area, densely and finely striated (Fig. 186, <i>d</i>): this is
  rubbed by some fine asperities on the inner part of the femur near its base. Sound is produced by
  this friction on the striated surface, the sculpture of which is abruptly contrasted with that of
  the contiguous parts: these structures seem to be somewhat better developed in the male than they
  are in the female, and to be phonetic, at any rate in the former sex. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page307"><span class="smaller">{307}</span></span>The male has the rudimentary tegmina (Fig.
  186, <i>f</i>) much longer than they are in the female (Fig. 185), and their prolonged part is
  deeply grooved, so as to give rise to strong ridges, over which plays the edge of the denticulate
  and serrate femur. There is nothing to correspond to this in the female, and friction over the
  surface of this part of the male produces a different and louder sound. There can be little doubt
  that this is a phonetic structure peculiar to the male. It approximates in situation to the
  sound-producing apparatus of the males of the Stenobothri and other Acridiidae. <i>Methone
  anderssoni</i> has large tympanal organs: the small tegmina cover them up completely. In the
  female the tips of the tegmina seem to be adapted for forming covering-flaps for the tympana. In
  both sexes there is a sac (Fig. 186, <i>b</i>) adjoining the structures we have mentioned, but
  which is not directly phonetic, though it may be an adjunct of the apparatus.</p>

  <p>There is no other Orthopteron in which the phonetic organs are so complex as they are in the
  male of <i>Methone anderssoni</i>, and it would appear probable that this Insect possesses the
  power of producing two, if not more, distinct sounds, one in common with the female, and peculiar
  to this and one or two other species; the other somewhat similar to that of other Acridiids, and
  more specially developed in the male, if not absolutely confined to it.</p>

  <p>This Insect is of a very sedentary disposition, and when disturbed apparently seeks safety
  rather by the noise it can make than by flight. Its powers of locomotion indeed are very feeble.
  The alar organs are quite rudimentary, and of no assistance whatever for movement. The hind legs
  seem to be almost equally useless for this purpose; they are broader than they are in other
  Acridiidae, and have different functions. When <i>Methone</i> moves it does so by means of the
  anterior four legs, on which it walks propped up as if on stilts. When at rest the hind legs are
  pressed close to the body, and the tibiae are inflexed and not seen, the creature in this position
  greatly resembling a clod of earth. We know nothing of the life history of this Insect, except
  that the young resemble the adult in appearance, and are provided with the sound-producing
  apparatus, or some portion thereof.</p>

  <p>The geographical distribution of the Eremobiens corresponds with that of the Pamphagides, with
  two important differences, viz. that in the Old World the former group occupies a somewhat <span
  class="pagenum" id="page308"><span class="smaller">{308}</span></span>more restricted area, and
  that it is represented in the New World by two peculiar North American genera, <i>Haldmanella</i>
  and <i>Brachystola</i>. <i>B. magna</i> is an Insect nearly equal in size to <i>Methone
  anderssoni</i>. Its peculiar form and movements have procured for it in Texas and Colorado the
  popular names of "buffalo hopper" and "lubber grasshopper." This Insect has not&mdash;like
  <i>Methone</i>&mdash;the colours of the desert sands; it is of a green tint, with comparatively
  smooth body, and during the day rests concealed under tufts of grass. It has apparently no sound
  organs, though de Saussure thinks there are structures present that are vestiges or rudiments
  thereof.</p>

  <p>The family Acridiidae includes a large part of the species that make up our meagre list of
  British Orthoptera. Indeed, the only native Orthoptera at the present time sufficiently common to
  attract general attention are, in addition to the earwig, the species of the genera
  <i>Stenobothrus</i> and <i>Gomphocerus</i>, whose musical instruments we have described
  previously. We have eight species of these Insects. They are the little grasshoppers, so common in
  our fields and gardens, the hunting of which is a source of much amusement to children. The Insect
  goes off with a sudden and long hop just as it is going to be seized, and this is appreciated by
  the child as very clever. The hunt, as a rule, does not result in much damage to the grasshoppers,
  the ingenious escape being the greater part of the pleasure. These <i>Stenobothri</i> are
  remarkable for their variation in colour, and it is thought by some that they frequent spots where
  they find themselves a match with their surroundings. There is, however, little or no information
  of importance on this point extant. <i>Mecostethus grossus</i> (Fig. 173), though larger, is very
  like the common field grasshoppers, but appears to have become rare since the fens were drained.
  The two curious little grasshoppers of the genus <i>Tettix</i> (Fig. 179) are not uncommon. In
  addition to these Acridiidae, three species of migratory locusts are occasionally met with in
  Britain, viz. <i>Pachytylus cinerascens</i> (Fig. 177), <i>P. migratorius</i>, and <i>Schistocerca
  peregrina</i> (Fig. 84); this latter we have already alluded to as being probably the locust
  mentioned in the book of Exodus.</p>

  <p>Acridiidae have never been found in amber, owing possibly to their large size and strength.
  There are but few fossil forms known, and these do not extend farther back in time than the
  Mesozoic <span class="pagenum" id="page309"><span class="smaller">{309}</span></span>epoch.
  Several forms, including three peculiar genera, have been found in the Tertiary strata at
  Florissant. The remains from the Mesozoic layers are apparently very fragmentary and obscure.</p>

  <p>Brongniart has instituted a family of Insects under the name Palaeacrididae<a id="NtA_242"
  href="#Nt_242"><sup>[242]</sup></a> for some fossil Insects from the Carboniferous strata at
  Commentry. He considers that these Insects were abundant in the epoch of the Carboniferous
  strata.</p>

  <p>An unfortunate confusion has long existed as to the term Locustidae, and has resulted in the
  application of the name to a group of Insects that contains none of the locusts of ordinary
  language. Some entomologists therefore use the term Phasgonuridea for this family, but the great
  majority prefer the term Locustidae.</p>

  <p>The Locustidae are, as a rule, more fragile Insects than the Acridiidae, from which they can be
  readily distinguished by the characters we have mentioned in our definition. According to Dufour,
  there are no air vesicles connected with the tracheal system in this family; possibly to this it
  may be due that none of the family undertake the long flights and migratory wanderings that have
  made some of the Acridiidae so notorious. Very little is known as to the life histories of the
  members of this extensive family of Orthoptera. Graber, however, has given some particulars as to
  the development of <i>Platycleis grisea</i>, and of one or two other species. He recognises five
  instars, but his first is probably really the second, as he did not observe the Insect in its
  youngest condition. Although his figures are very poor, we reproduce them, as they give some idea
  of the mode of growth of the wings, and of the correlative changes in the thoracic segments. It
  will be seen that in the first three of these instars the alar organs appear merely as
  prolongations of the sides of the posterior two thoracic rings, and that in D a great change has
  occurred in the position of these segments, so that the alar organs are free processes, the two
  posterior thoracic rings being insignificant in size in comparison with the now greatly developed
  prothorax. In E the tegmen is shown fully developed, the positions of some <span class="pagenum"
  id="page313"><span class="smaller">{313}</span></span>of the rings covered by it being indicated
  by the letters <i>m</i>, <i>mt</i>, <i>ab&prime;</i>. These changes are very similar to those we
  have described in Acridiidae, the chief difference being the greater development of the dependent
  wing-pads previous to the fourth instar.</p>

  <p>The ocelli in Locustidae are much more imperfect than they are in Acridiidae, and are
  frequently rudimentary or nearly totally absent, or there may be but one instead of three. They
  are, however, present in a fairly well-developed state in some species, and this is the case with
  the one whose face we portray in Fig. 189, where the anterior of the three ocelli is quite
  conspicuous, the other two being placed one on each side of the curious frontal cone near its
  base. The peculiar head ornament shown in this figure exists in both sexes, and something similar
  occurs in a large number of Conocephalides. We have not the slightest idea of its import.
  Individuals of one or more species of this curious South American genus are occasionally met with
  alive in gardens near London. They are, no doubt, imported as eggs, for they are sometimes met
  with in the juvenile state, but in what way they are introduced is not known.</p>

  <p>The ovipositor frequently attains a great length in these Insects, so as to exceed that of the
  body. It is used in different ways, some of the family depositing their eggs in the earth, perhaps
  in vegetable matter under the surface; but other species place the ova in twigs or stems of
  plants, arranging them in a very neat and compact manner in two series, as depicted by Riley<a
  id="NtA_245" href="#Nt_245"><sup>[245]</sup></a> in the case of <i>Microcentrum retinerve</i>
  (Fig. 190). These eggs are laid in the autumn, and in the following spring become more swollen
  before hatching. The Insect undergoes a moult during the process of emerging from the egg. By the
  time the emergence is completed the <i>Microcentrum</i> has expanded so much <span class="pagenum"
  id="page314"><span class="smaller">{314}</span></span>in size that it is a matter of astonishment
  how it can ever have been packed in the egg; the young commence jumping and eating leaves in a few
  minutes. Including the ecdysis made on leaving the egg, they cast their skins five times. The
  post-embryonic development occupies a period of about ten weeks. The larvae eat their cast skins.
  When the final moult occurs the tegmina and wings are at first quite soft and colourless, but
  within an hour they assume their green colour. These Insects, as remarked by Riley, make
  interesting pets. The people of the Amazon valley are in the habit of keeping a species in cages,
  and our British <i>Locusta viridissima</i> does very well in confinement. One of the most curious
  habits of these Locustidae is a constant licking of the front paws. Riley says that <i>M.
  retinerve</i> bestows as much attention on its long graceful antenn&aelig; as many a maiden does upon
  her abundant tresses, the antenn&aelig; being drawn between the jaws and smoothed by the palpi. This
  American naturalist also tells us that he reared three successive broods in confinement, and that
  the Insects gradually deteriorated, so that the eggs of the third generation failed to hatch.</p>

  <p>The ovipositor, which is one of the most characteristic features of the Locustidae, is not
  present in the newly-hatched Locustid (Fig. 191, A), the organ being then represented only by two
  papillae placed on the penultimate segment. The structure and development of the ovipositor in
  <i>Locusta viridissima</i> have been described by Dewitz.<a id="NtA_246"
  href="#Nt_246"><sup>[246]</sup></a> Fig. 191, A, shows the young Insect taken from the egg just as
  it is about to emerge. The abdomen consists of ten segments, the terminal one bearing at its
  extremity two processes, the cerci, <i>a&prime;</i>. These persist throughout the life of the
  Insect, and take no part in the formation of the ovipositor. The tenth segment subsequently
  divides into two (<i>a</i>, <i>a'&prime;</i>, Fig. 191, C), giving rise to the appearance of
  eleven abdominal segments, and of the ovipositor springing from the antepenultimate.</p>

  <p>Near to one another, on the middle of the ventral aspect of the true ninth abdominal segment,
  are seen the two papillae (<i>b&prime;</i>), which at first are the only visible indications of
  the future ovipositor. If, however, the integument be taken off and carefully examined, it will be
  found that there exist on the eighth abdominal plate two spots, where there is a slight thickening
  and prominence of the integument (Fig. 191, B, <i>c</i>). From these two spots the two lower rods
  of the ovipositor are produced; these two, together with the two growths from the ninth segment,
  form the four external rods of the ovipositor. Inside these there exist in the completed structure
  two other rods (Fig. 192, B, <i>b'&prime;</i>). These are produced by a growth from the inner
  parts of the two papillae of the ninth segment. The relations of the six rods in their early
  condition are shown in Fig. 191, C, where the two primary papillae <i>b&prime;</i> of the ninth
  segment are seen with their secondary offshoots <i>b&Prime;</i>; <i>c&prime;</i> being the
  papillae of the eighth segment. The subsequent relations of the pieces are shown in Fig. 192; A
  exhibiting the base of the organ with the lower rods turned on one side to show the others, the
  shaded parts indicating <span class="pagenum" id="page316"><span

  In these figures the different parts of the appendages bear the same lettering as they do in Fig.
  191. It will be seen that in the completed structures the parts <i>c&prime;</i> have become very
  intimately connected with the parts <i>b&prime;</i> and <i>b&Prime;</i>, which belong to another
  segment.</p>

  <p>The Locustidae resemble the Acridiidae in the possession of specialised ears and
  sound-producing organs; neither of these is, however, situate in the same part of the body as in
  Acridiidae. The ears of Locustidae are placed on the front legs, below the knee; a tympanum (Fig.
  193, A), or a crack giving entrance to a cavity in which the tympanum is placed (Fig. 193, B),
  being seen on each side of each of the anterior pair of limbs. In this family, as in the
  Acridiidae, three kinds of ear are recognised according to the condition of the tympanum, which is
  either exposed (Fig. 193, A) or closed by an overgrowth of the integument (Fig. 193, B), or in a
  condition to a certain extent different from either of these. The existence of ears placed on the
  legs is a curious fact, but it is beyond doubt in the Locustidae, and there is good reason for
  believing that analogous organs exist in this situation in other Insects that have special means
  of sound-production, such as the ants and the Termites.</p>

  <p>The structure of these organs in the Locustidae has been investigated by Graber,<a id="NtA_247"
  href="#Nt_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a> and their acoustic functions placed beyond doubt, though to
  what special kind of sounds they may be sensitive is not ascertained, this point being surrounded
  by even greater difficulties than those we have discussed in the case of the Acridiidae. In the
  Locustidae there is a special structure of a remarkable nature in connexion with the ears. In
  Acridiidae <span class="pagenum" id="page317"><span class="smaller">{317}</span></span>a stigma is
  placed close to the ear, and supplies the internal structures of the organ with air. There are no
  stigmata on the legs of Insects, consequently admission of air to the acoustic apparatus in
  Locustidae is effected by means of a gaping orifice at the back of the prothorax, just over the
  base of the front leg (Fig. 101); this communicates with its fellow of the other side, and from
  them there extend processes along the femora into the tibiae, where they undergo dilatation, so as
  to form vesicular cavities, one of which is in proximity to each drum of the ear. These
  leg-tracheae are not connected with the ordinary tracheal system; the prothoracic stigma exists in
  close proximity to the acoustic orifice we have described, but is much smaller than it. It is not
  yet clear why the acoustic apparatus should require a supply of air apart from that which could be
  afforded by the ordinary tracheal system. This special arrangement&mdash;to which there is hardly
  a parallel in Insect anatomy&mdash;has still to be accounted for; we do not know whether the
  necessity for it may be connected with the respiratory system or the acoustic organ.</p>

  <p>The chief features of the acoustic apparatus of the legs of Locustidae will be gathered from
  the accompanying diagrammatic transverse section through the tibia. In this figure the deep black
  parts indicate the outer wall of the tibia and its prolongations, the white spaces indicate the
  parts filled with air, while the dotted portions are occupied by blood or some of the body
  organs;<a id="NtA_248" href="#Nt_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a> the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page318"><span class="smaller">{318}</span></span>circular space <i>o&Prime;</i> is not part
  of the actual structure, but represents the area of the external acoustic orifice of the
  prothorax; it is not, however, so large as it should be.</p>

  <p>Although the tibial ears of Locustidae are very perfect organs, there is great difficulty in
  deciding on the exact nature of their functions. They would appear to be admirably adapted to
  determine the precise locality from which a sound proceeds, especially in those cases&mdash;and
  they are the highest forms&mdash;in which the tympanum is placed in a cavity the external orifice
  of which is a slit (Fig. 193, B); for the legs can be moved in the freest manner in every
  direction, so as to bring the drum into the most direct line of the vibrations. But as to what
  kinds of vibrations may be perceived, and the manner in which they may be transmitted to the
  nerves, there is but little evidence. On reference to the diagram it will be noticed that the
  tympanum, the tympanal vesicles, and the nervous apparatus are not in close connexion, so that
  even the mode by which the impulses are transmitted is obscure.</p>

  <p>The musical organs of the Locustidae are different from those of the Acridiidae, and are
  invariably situate on the basal part of the tegmina. They are found, in the great majority of
  cases, only in the male; in the tribes Ephippigerides and Callimenides they exist in each sex. One
  of the wings bears a file on its inner surface, while the other&mdash;on the right side of the
  body&mdash;is provided with a sharp edge placed on a prominent part of its inner margin. By
  slightly tilting the tegmina and vibrating them rapidly, the edge passes under the file, and a
  musical sound is produced. These structures are limited to the small anal area of the wing, and
  when the tegmina are very greatly reduced in size, it is this part that still remains. There is
  much variety in the details of the structure. The nervures of this part of the tegmina are
  different in the male from what they are in the female, and, moreover, the two wing-covers of the
  male differ from one another. It is apparently the vibrations of the right tegmen that produce the
  sound, and this part usually bears a space of a glassy nature, which probably improves the
  character of the sound produced. Our chief British songster of this group, <i>Locusta
  viridissima</i>, is only provided with phonetic organs (Fig. 195) of a somewhat imperfect
  character, but in the genus <i>Mecopoda</i> there is great perfection of the structures. The anal
  areas of the two tegmina are in this case <span class="pagenum" id="page319"><span
  class="smaller">{319}</span></span>very different; that of the left one, which bears the file,
  being similar in texture to the rest of the wing-cover, while the corresponding part of the other
  tegmen is rigid and transparent, and greatly distorted, so as to create a cavity which, no doubt,
  improves the sound; the scraper too is very perfectly formed. The difference between this form of
  musical organ and that of <i>L. viridissima</i> is curious, inasmuch as in the better instrument
  the important modifications are confined to one tegmen, while in the other form both tegmina are
  largely changed. The difference appears to be that in <i>Locusta</i> the left tegmen, as well as
  the right one, acts as a sounding-board, while in <i>Mecopoda</i> it does not do so, but when the
  wings are closed quite covers and conceals the musical instrument.</p>

  <p>The Locustidae, notwithstanding the fact that their alar organs are generally more ample than
  those of the Acridiidae, seem to be, as a rule, of more sedentary habits, and more nocturnal in
  their activity. The musical powers of the different species are very varied. <i>Locusta
  viridissima</i> produces a shrill and monotonous but not disagreeable, sound, and is capable of
  sustaining it for a quarter of an hour without any intermission, except a break for the sake of
  starting again immediately with greater force, like a performer on a flute. It occasionally chirps
  in the day, but the act is then very brief. Bates informs us that one of these singing
  grasshoppers, called Tanan&aacute; by the natives of the Amazon valley, is much admired for its singing,
  and is kept in little cages. The Amazonian naturalist thought the music of this species superior
  to that of any other Orthopterous Insect he had heard. The name of this grasshopper is
  <i>Thliboscelus camellifolius</i>. It is very similar in appearance to <i>Cyrtophyllus
  crepitans</i>, the Insect we have represented in Fig. 187.</p>

  <p>The most notorious of the musical Locustids are the Katydids <span class="pagenum"
  id="page320"><span class="smaller">{320}</span></span>of North America. There are several species
  of them&mdash;they belong, indeed, to more than one genus,&mdash;but it seems that sounds somewhat
  resembling the words Katy-did are perceptible in most of their performances. These sounds are
  frequently repeated with slight variations&mdash;Katy-did, O-she-did, Katy-did-she-did. Riley
  describes the music of the Katydid we represent in Fig. 196 as follows:<a id="NtA_249"
  href="#Nt_249"><sup>[249]</sup></a> "The first notes from this Katydid are heard about the middle
  of July, and the species is in full song by the first of August. The wing-covers are partially
  opened by a sudden jerk, and the notes produced by the gradual closing of the same. The song
  consists of a series of from twenty-five to thirty raspings, as of a stiff quill drawn across a
  coarse file. There are about five of these raspings or trills per second, all alike, and with
  equal intervals, except the last two or three, which, with the closing of the wing-covers, run
  into each other. The whole strongly recalls the slow turning of a child's wooden rattle, ending by
  a sudden jerk of the same; and this prolonged rattling, which is peculiar to the male, is
  invariably and instantly answered by a single sharp 'chirp' or 'tschick' from one or more females,
  who produce the sound by a sudden upward jerk of the wings."</p>

  </div>

  <p>Pertinacity is one of the most curious features of the performance of musical Locustids. One
  would say they desire to distinguish themselves as much as possible. Harris says that
  <i>Cyrtophyllus concavus</i> mounts on the uppermost twigs of trees and there performs its
  Katy-did-she-did in rivalry with others. He says even the female in this species gives forth a
  feeble noise. Scudder says that some of the Katydids sing both by day and night, but their day
  song differs from that of the night. "On a summer's day it is curious to observe these little
  creatures suddenly <span class="pagenum" id="page321"><span
  class="smaller">{321}</span></span>changing from the day to the night song at the mere passing of
  a cloud, and returning to the old note when the sky is clear. By imitating the two songs in the
  daytime the grasshoppers can be made to respond to either at will; at night they have but one
  note."</p>

  <p>Although but little is known as to the habits of Locustidae, it is ascertained that they are
  less exclusively herbivorous in their food habits than the Acridiidae are; many seem to prefer a
  mixed diet. <i>Locusta viridissima</i> will eat various leaves and fruits, besides small
  quantities of flesh. It has been recorded that a specimen in confinement mastered a humble-bee,
  extracted with its mandibles the honey-bag, and ate this dainty, leaving the other parts of the
  bee untouched. Many of the Locustidae are believed to be entirely carnivorous. Brunner considers a
  minority to be exclusively phytophagous. The species very rarely increase to large numbers; this,
  however, occurs sometimes with <i>Orphania denticauda</i> and <i>Barbitistes yersini</i> in
  Europe, and <i>Anabrus purpurascens</i> in North America. We have already mentioned that the eggs
  of some species are deposited in parts of plants, and of others in the earth. The British
  <i>Meconema varium</i> deposits its eggs in the galls of <i>Cynips</i> in the autumn; these eggs
  do not hatch till the following spring. <i>Xiphidium ensiferum</i> has somewhat similar habits in
  North America, the gall selected for the reception of the eggs being the scales formed by a
  species of <i>Cecidomyia</i> on the leaves of willows. It has been ascertained that the
  development of the embryo in the last-named species is commenced in the autumn, but is suspended
  during the winter, being only completed in the following spring, eight or nine months afterwards.
  We owe to Wheeler<a id="NtA_250" href="#Nt_250"><sup>[250]</sup></a> a memoir on the embryology of
  this Insect.</p>

  <p>Some of the species have the peculiar habit of dwelling in caves. This is especially the case
  with the members of the tribe Stenopelmatides (Fig. 197), which frequently possess enormously long
  antennae and legs, and are destitute of alar organs and ears. The species with this habit, though
  found in the most widely separated parts of the world, have a great general resemblance, so that
  one would almost suppose the specimens found in the caves of Austria, in the Mammoth cave of
  Kentucky, and in the rock-cavities of New Zealand to be one <span class="pagenum"
  id="page322"><span class="smaller">{322}</span></span>species, although they are now referred by
  entomologists to different genera.</p>

      ocellata</i>: <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, marks like those made by Insects on leaves.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The Locustidae display in the greatest possible perfection that resemblance of the tegmina to
  leaves which we mentioned when speaking of the general characters of the Orthoptera. The
  wing-covers are very leaf-like in colour and appearance in many Locustidae, but it is in the tribe
  Pseudophyllides and in the South American genus <i>Pterochroza</i> (Fig. 198) that the phenomenon
  is most remarkable. The tegmina in the species of this genus look exactly like leaves in certain
  stages of ripeness or decay. In the tegmina of some of the species not only are the colours of
  faded leaves exactly reproduced, but spots are present like those on leaves due to cryptogamic
  growths. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of these resemblances is the one pointed out by
  Brunner von Wattenwyl,<a id="NtA_251" href="#Nt_251"><sup>[251]</sup></a> viz. that the tracks and
  spots formed on leaves by the mining of Insects in their tissues are also represented in the
  leaf-like wing-covers of the <i>Pterochroza</i>; transparent spots (<i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, Fig. 198)
  being present, just as they are in many leaves that have been attacked by Insects. Brunner was so
  much impressed by these facts that he came to the conclusion that they cannot be accounted for on
  the grounds of mere utility, <span class="pagenum" id="page323"><span
  class="smaller">{323}</span></span>and proposed the term Hypertely to express the idea that in
  these cases the bounds of the useful are transcended. We will mention here another peculiar case
  of resemblance described by Brunner as occurring in a Locustid. Two specimens of a little
  Phaneropterid were brought from the Soudan by the Antinori expedition, and have been described by
  Brunner under the name of <i>Myrmecophana fallax</i>. The Insect is said to bear an extraordinary
  resemblance to an ant. The most peculiar feature in the resemblance is shown in Fig. 199, A, B.
  The most characteristic point in the external form of an ant is the stalked abdomen, this
  structure being at the same time quite foreign to the Orthoptera. In the other parts of the body
  and in the colour generally, the <i>Myrmecophana</i> resembles an ant, but the abdomen of the
  Orthopteron is not stalked; it has, however, the appearance of being so, in consequence of certain
  parts being of a white colour, as shown in our figure. If abstraction be made of the white parts,
  the form of the stalked abdomen of the ant is nicely reproduced. The specimens brought from the
  Soudan were wingless and destitute of ovipositor, and may be immature, but Brunner suggests that
  they may prove to be really mature, the ovipositor, tegmina, and wings being permanently absent.
  The existence of a long ovipositor would certainly detract greatly from the ant-like appearance of
  the Orthopteron.</p>

  </div>

  <p>It is certain that the plant-like appearance of some of the Locustidae renders them
  inconspicuous to the human eye in the situations they frequent. It is a matter of common
  observation that though the noise of their chirpings may be heard to such an extent as to make it
  certain that many individuals must be in the immediate neighbourhood, yet at the same time it may
  be most difficult to detect even a single individual. M. Boutan noticed this phenomenon in the
  case of <i>Ephippigera rugosicollis</i>, and tells us that the human eye can, with a little
  practice, acquire the art of detecting these concealed creatures. This consists <span
  class="pagenum" id="page324"><span class="smaller">{324}</span></span>apparently in making use,
  not of a general inspection, but of a scrutiny of the outlines of the leaves and twigs of a tree.
  By this means, when the eye is accustomed to the task, the Insects can be detected with
  comparative ease; much in the same way, M. Boutan says, as a figure, placed in an engraving in
  such a way as to elude the eye, is appreciated with ease after the eye has once perceived it.</p>

  <p>Some of the Locustidae are provided with means of defence of a positive nature. The Algerian
  <i>Eugaster guyoni</i> ejects two jets of a caustic orange-coloured fluid from two pores situate
  on the sides of the mesosternum, and covered by the anterior coxae. This species is carnivorous as
  well as herbivorous, and produces a sound more like humming than stridulation.<a id="NtA_252"

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>We have previously pointed out that some of the Acridiidae resemble the stick-Insects rather
  than the members of their own group; and similar cases occur amongst the Locustidae. Such a
  resemblance has, however, only been found in a few species of the tribe Prochilides. We figure one
  of these, <i>Phasmodes ranatriformis</i>, a native of South-West Australia. The very elongate
  linear form and the total absence of alar organs give this Insect a considerable resemblance to
  the stick-Insects or apterous Phasmidae. <i>Prochilus australis</i> is allied to this curious
  Locustid, but the alar organs are present in both sexes, and the Insect bears a great resemblance
  to the winged Phasmidae. This is due not only to the general form and colour, but also to the fact
  that the tegmina are very narrow, which <span class="pagenum" id="page325"><span
  class="smaller">{325}</span></span>causes them to look like the coloured slip on the anterior
  parts of the wings of some of the Phasmidae (cf. <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page266">266</a></span>). Another case of a Locustid with elongate, slender form is found
  in the extraordinary <i>Peringueyella jocosa</i> of South Africa, a member of the tribe Sagides.
  It has minute organs of flight, and reproduces, to a considerable extent, the form and appearance
  of Proscopides or of some Tryxalides.<a id="NtA_253" href="#Nt_253"><sup>[253]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We follow Brunner in placing among the Locustidae the large Insect we represent in Fig. 201. It
  is remarkable on account of its tegmina and wings; these have their extremities much prolonged and
  curled; moreover, the flat interior area and the abruptly <span class="pagenum" id="page326"><span
  class="smaller">{326}</span></span>deflexed exterior area make them look more like the wings of
  Gryllidae. This species has no ocelli, and is said to be destitute of ears. The inflated condition
  of the anterior and middle tibiae suggest that it possesses auditory structures, though there
  appears to be no external opening for them. This Insect is found in India, where it is said to be
  common on the banks of sandy rivers, living there in burrows of the depth of three feet. Very
  little is known, however, as to this curious Insect. It has recently been reported<a id="NtA_254"
  href="#Nt_254"><sup>[254]</sup></a> as being injurious to tobacco and other crops on high ground
  in Durbungha by cutting off their roots. The local name for the Insect is <i>bherwa</i>. We should
  think it somewhat doubtful whether this refers really to <i>S. monstrosus</i>.</p>

  <p>In number of species the Locustidae are perhaps scarcely inferior to the Acridiidae, and in
  variety of form they surpass this latter family. Many of the most gigantic forms are apterous, and
  these very often have a repellant aspect. The genus <i>Anostostoma</i> is remarkable for its large
  head. Allied to it is <i>Deinacrida heteracantha</i>, the "Weta-punga" of the New Zealand natives,
  an Insect formerly abundant in the forests north of Auckland, but of late years become extremely
  rare. The head and body of this Insect may measure more than 2&frac12; inches in length, and when the
  antennae and legs are stretched out the total length may be 14 or 15 inches. Although bulky and
  absolutely wingless, yet, as Buller informs us,<a id="NtA_255" href="#Nt_255"><sup>[255]</sup></a>
  it climbs with agility, and is sometimes found on the topmost branches of lofty trees. When
  disturbed it produces a clicking, accompanied by a slow movement <span class="pagenum"
  id="page327"><span class="smaller">{327}</span></span>of its hind legs. A second species, <i>D.
  thoracica</i>, lives in decayed wood, and a third, <i>D. megacephala</i>, is remarkable from the
  very large size of the head and mandibles in the male sex. The fact that a clicking noise is
  produced by the Weta-punga is of some interest, for the genus <i>Deinacrida</i> is among the
  Locustidae that possess ears, but are said to be destitute of sound-producing organs.</p>

  <p>Amongst the most remarkable of the Locustidae are the two species of which Brongniart has
  recently formed the genus <i>Eumegalodon</i> and the tribe Eumegalodonidae, which is not included
  in Brunner's table of the tribes of Locustidae. The ovipositor is large and sabre-shaped; the male
  is unknown. The genus <i>Megalodon</i> is placed by Brunner in the tribe Conocephalides; it also
  consists of extremely remarkable Insects.</p>

  <p>The Locustidae appear to be of slow growth, and the autumns of Britain are usually not warm
  enough for them. Hence we have but nine British species, and of this number only three or four are
  known to occur north of the Thames. The only one that attracts attention is <i>Locusta
  viridissima</i>, which in some districts of the south of England occurs in considerable numbers,
  and attests its presence by its peculiar music. It is called the green grasshopper.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page328"><span class="smaller">{328}</span></span></div>

  <p class="sp3">The geological record is rather obscure in the matter of Locustidae. Scudder
  considers that a fair number of Tertiary forms are known, and says that they represent several of
  the existing tribes and genera. One or two have been found in Mesozoic rocks.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Fam. VIII. Gryllidae&mdash;Crickets.</b></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Antennae very slender, generally long and setaceous; hind legs long,
    saltatorial. Tegmina with the outer portion deflexed on to the side of the body, and with the
    inner part lying flat on the body. Tarsi usually three-jointed (rarely two- or four-jointed).
    Female with a long ovipositor (except in Gryllotalpides). Apterous forms numerous.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>The Gryllidae are closely connected with the Locustidae, the musical and auditory organs being
  in both similarly situate, and the female in both possessing, in most of the tribes, an elongate
  exserted ovipositor. The two families differ in the number of joints of the tarsi, in the form of
  the tegmina, and in the fact that in Gryllidae the portion of the wing modified for musical
  purposes consists of a larger portion of the organ&mdash;according to de Saussure, the discoidal
  as well as the anal area.</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 204.</span>&mdash;House-cricket, <i>Gryllus</i>
      (<i>Acheta</i>) <i>domesticus</i>, male.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The family would be a very natural one if we were to exclude from it the mole-crickets which
  have fossorial front legs and no ovipositor, and the Tridactylides, which also are <span
  class="pagenum" id="page331"><span class="smaller">{331}</span></span>destitute of ovipositor, and
  have short antennae, consisting of about ten joints.</p>

  <p>The head is generally very large; ocelli are present, though usually imperfect; the extremity
  of the body bears a pair of remarkably long cerci. The hind tibiae are usually armed with very
  strong spines; the first joint of the hind tarsus is elongate, and terminates in two spines,
  between which the small second joint is often almost completely concealed; the feet are not
  provided beneath with pads, but only bear remote setae.</p>

  <p>The alar organs are difficult of comprehension, and different opinions prevail as to their
  morphology. The tegmina are extremely different to the hind wings, and never attain large
  dimensions, neither do they exhibit any leaf-like or ornamental structures. In the genus
  <i>Pteroplistus</i> they are formed somewhat like the elytra of Coleoptera, and close over the
  back of the Insect in a fashion very like that found in beetles. According to Brunner the larger
  part of the tegmen&mdash;which, as we have said, reposes flat on the back of the
  Insect&mdash;represents merely the anal area, and all the other parts must be sought in the
  smaller, deflexed portion of the wing-cover. De Saussure's opinion, to a somewhat different
  effect, we have already mentioned. The tegmina of the male are extremely different from those of
  the female, so that it is a matter of much difficulty to decide what nervures correspond.<a

      house-cricket. <b>A</b>, male, inner aspect; <b>B</b>, female, outer aspect: <i>a</i>, inner
      margin; <i>b</i>, outer margin; <i>c</i>, nervure bearing stridulating file.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The wing-covers of the male differ from those of the Locustidae, inasmuch as the pair are of
  similar formation, each bearing a stridulating file on its lower aspect. This file projects
  somewhat inwards, so that its position is marked on the outer aspect of the wing-cover by a
  depression. Usually the right tegmen overlaps the other, an arrangement contrary to that which
  prevails in other Orthoptera. The wings are ample and delicate; they possess numerous nervures
  that are not much forked and have a <span class="pagenum" id="page332"><span
  class="smaller">{332}</span></span>simple, somewhat fan-like arrangement; the little transverse
  nervules exhibit only slight variety. These wings are frequently rolled up at the apex, and
  project beyond the body like an additional pair of cerci (Fig. 204). The abdomen is chiefly
  remarkable for the large development of the pleura, the stigmata being consequently very
  conspicuous. The cerci are not jointed, though they are flexible and, often, very long; they bear
  a variety of sense-organs (Fig. 67). The saltatorial powers of the crickets are frequently
  considerable.</p>

  <p>Graber has observed the post-embryonic development of the field-cricket, <i>Gryllus
  campestris</i>, though unfortunately not from the very commencement, so that we do not know
  whether there are five, six, or seven ecdyses; the number is probably either six or seven. The
  manner in which the alar organs are developed is similar to that we have described and figured in
  the Locustidae. In the earlier instars there is a slight prolongation of each side of the meso-
  and meta-notum, but about the middle of the development a considerable change occurs&mdash;the
  rudimentary organs then become free appendages and assume a different position.</p>

  <p>The Gryllidae possess a pair of tympana on each front leg, but these organs contrast with those
  of the Locustidae in that the pair on each leg usually differ from one another, the one on the
  outer or posterior aspect being larger than that on the inner or front face of the leg.</p>

  <p>The ears of the Gryllidae have not been so well investigated as those of the Locustidae, but
  are apparently of a much less perfect nature. No orifice for the admission of air other than that
  of the prothoracic stigma has been detected, except in <i>Gryllotalpa</i>. On the other hand, it
  is said<a id="NtA_260" href="#Nt_260"><sup>[260]</sup></a> that in addition to the tibial organs
  another pair of tympana exists, and is seated on the second abdominal segment in a position
  analogous to that occupied by the ear on the first segment of Acridiidae.</p>

  <p>The musical powers of the crickets are remarkable, and are familiar to all in Europe, as the
  performance of the house-cricket gives a fair idea of them. Some of the Insects of the family are
  able to make a very piercing noise, the note of <i>Brachytrypes megacephalus</i> having been
  heard, it is said, at a distance of a mile from where it was being produced. The mode of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page333"><span class="smaller">{333}</span></span>production is the same as in
  the Locustidae, rapid vibration of the tegmina causing the edge of one of them to act on the file
  of the other.</p>

  <p>The mole-cricket, <i>Gryllotalpa vulgaris</i>&mdash;the <i>Werre</i> of the Germans,
  <i>Courtili&egrave;re</i> of the French&mdash;is placed with a few allies in a special group,
  Gryllotalpides, characterised by the dilated front legs, which are admirably adapted for working
  underground. Like the mole, this Insect has a subterranean existence. It travels in burrows of its
  own formation, and it also forms beneath the surface a habitation for its eggs and family. Its
  habits have been alluded to by Gilbert White,<a id="NtA_261" href="#Nt_261"><sup>[261]</sup></a>
  who tells us that "a gardener at a house where I was on a visit, happening to be mowing, on the
  6th of May, by the side of a canal, his scythe struck too deep, pared off a large piece of turf,
  and laid open to view a curious scene of domestic economy: there were many caverns and winding
  passages leading to a kind of chamber, neatly smoothed and rounded, and about the size of a
  moderate snuff-box. Within this secret nursery were deposited near a hundred eggs of a dirty
  yellow colour, and enveloped in a tough skin, but too lately excluded to contain any rudiments of
  young, being full of a viscous substance. The eggs lay but shallow, and within the influence of
  the sun, just under a little heap of fresh moved mould like that which is raised by ants."</p>

      <b>A</b>, outer; <b>B</b>, inner aspect: <i>e</i>, ear-slit.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The front legs are remarkable structures (Fig. 206), being beautifully adapted for burrowing;
  the tibiae and tarsi are arranged so as to act as shears when it may be necessary to sever a root.
  The shear-like action of the tarsus and tibia is very remarkable; the first and second joints of
  the former are furnished with hard processes, which, when the tarsus is moved, pass over the edges
  of the tibial teeth in such a way as to be more effective than a pair of shears. In consequence of
  its habit of cutting roots, <span class="pagenum" id="page334"><span
  class="smaller">{334}</span></span>the mole-cricket causes some damage where it is abundant. It is
  now a rare Insect in England, and is almost confined to the southern counties, but in the gardens
  of Central and Southern Europe it is very abundant. Its French name <i>courtili&egrave;re</i> is supposed
  to be a corruption of the Latin <i>curtilla</i>. Its fondness for the neighbourhood of water is
  well known. De Saussure says that in order to secure specimens it is only necessary to throw water
  on the paths between the flower-beds of gardens and to cover the wetted places with pieces of
  board; in the morning some of these Insects are almost sure to be found under the boards
  disporting themselves in the mud. The Gryllotalpae swim admirably by aid of their broad front
  legs.</p>

  <p>Ears exist in the mole-cricket, and are situate on the front leg below the knee, as in other
  Gryllidae, although it seems strange that a leg so profoundly modified for digging and excavating
  as is that of the mole-cricket should be provided with an ear. In <i>Gryllotalpa</i> the ear is
  concealed and protected by being placed in a deep slit or fold of the surface, and this depression
  is all that can be seen by examination of the exterior (Fig. 206, <i>e</i>). In the allied genus
  <i>Scapteriscus</i> the tympanal membrane is, however, destitute of special protection, being
  completely exposed on the surface of the leg.</p>

  <p>Although the tegmina or upper wings in <i>Gryllotalpa</i> are of small size, yet the true wings
  are much more ample; they are of delicate texture and traversed by many nearly straight radii, so
  that they close up in the most complete manner, and form the two long delicate, flexible processes
  that in the state of repose may be seen projecting not only beyond the tegmina, but actually
  surpassing the extremity of the body hanging down behind it, and looking like a second pair of
  cerci.</p>

  <p>The mole-cricket is believed to be chiefly carnivorous in its diet, though, like many other
  Orthoptera, it can accommodate its appetite to parts of the vegetable as well as of the animal
  kingdom. The Insect is capable of emitting a sound consisting of a dull jarring note, somewhat
  like that of the goat-sucker. For this purpose the tegmina of the males are provided with an
  apparatus of the nature we have already described, but which is very much smaller and less
  elaborate than it is in the true crickets.</p>

      (After Dufour.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The alimentary canal and digestive system of <i>Gryllotalpa</i> present peculiarities worthy of
  notice. Salivary glands and reservoirs are present; the oesophagus is elongate, and has on one
  side a peculiar large pouch (Fig. 207, <i>c</i>); beyond this is the gizzard, which is embraced by
  two lobes of the stomach. This latter organ is, beyond the lobes, continued backwards as a neck,
  which subsequently becomes larger and rugose-plicate. On the neck of the stomach there is a pair
  of branching organs, which Dufour considered to be peculiar to the mole-cricket, and compared to a
  spleen or pancreas. The single tube into which the Malpighian tubules open is seated near the
  commencement of the small intestine. These tubules are very fine, and are about one hundred in
  number. The arrangement by which the Malpighian tubules open into a common duct instead of into
  the intestine itself appears to be characteristic of the Gryllidae, but is said to occur also in
  <i>Ephippigera</i>, a genus of Locustidae. According to Leydig<a id="NtA_262"
  href="#Nt_262"><sup>[262]</sup></a> and Schindler the Malpighian tubules are of two kinds,
  differing in colour, and, according to Leydig, in contents and histological structure. Near the
  posterior extremity of the rectum there is a lobulated gland having a reservoir connected with it;
  this is the chief source of the foetid secretion the mole-cricket emits when seized. The nervous
  chain consists of three thoracic and four abdominal ganglia; these latter do not extend to the
  extremity of the body; <span class="pagenum" id="page336"><span
  class="smaller">{336}</span></span>the three anterior of the four ganglia are but small, the
  terminal one being much larger.</p>

  <p>The number of eggs deposited by a female mole-cricket is large, varying, it is said, from 200
  to 400. The mother watches over them carefully, and when they are hatched, which occurs in a
  period of from three to four weeks after their deposition, she supplies the young with food till
  their first moult; after this occurs they disperse, and begin to form burrows for themselves.</p>

  <p>It has been said that the young are devoured by their parents, and some writers have gone so
  far as to say that 90 per cent of the progeny are thus disposed of. M. Decaux, who has paid
  considerable attention to the economy of the mole-cricket,<a id="NtA_263"
  href="#Nt_263"><sup>[263]</sup></a> acquits the mother of such an offence, but admits that the
  male commits it. The number of eggs in one nest is said to be about 300.</p>

  <p>The embryonic development of the mole-cricket has been studied by Dohrn<a id="NtA_264"
  href="#Nt_264"><sup>[264]</sup></a> and Korotneff,<a id="NtA_265"
  href="#Nt_265"><sup>[265]</sup></a> and is considered by the former to be of great interest. The
  tracheae connected with each stigma remain isolated, while, according to Korotneff, the
  development of the alimentary canal is not completed when the young mole-cricket is hatched.
  Perhaps it may be this condition of the digestive organs that necessitates the unusual care the
  mother bestows on her young.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The genus <i>Cylindrodes</i> (Fig. 208, <i>C. kochi</i>) comprises some curious and rare
  Insects of elongate, slender form. They are natives of Australia, where the first species known of
  the genus was found in Melville Island by Major Campbell, from whom we learn that these Insects
  burrow in the stems of plants, and are so destructive that he was unable to keep a single plant in
  his greenhouse on account of the ravages of <i>Cylindrodes campbellii</i>. The form of these
  Insects is beautifully adapted to <span class="pagenum" id="page337"><span
  class="smaller">{337}</span></span>their habits, the body being contracted in the middle in such a
  way as to permit the middle and hind legs to be packed against it, so that the cylindrical form is
  not interfered with by these appendages while the excavating anterior legs are at work in front of
  the Insect. The abdomen has nine segments; the terminal one, said to be remarkably long and
  destitute of cerci, is not shown in our figure.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Tridactylus</i> is considered by de Saussure to form, with its ally
  <i>Rhipipteryx</i>, a division of Gryllotalpinae, but they are treated, perhaps more correctly, by
  Brunner as a separate tribe. <i>T. variegatus</i> (Fig. 209) is a small Insect, abundant in sandy
  places on the banks of rivers in Southern Europe,&mdash;extending on the Rhone as far north as
  Geneva,&mdash;and is remarkable for its great power of leaping, and for the rapidity with which it
  can burrow in the sand. This anomalous Insect has only ten joints to the antennae. Its alar organs
  are imperfect, and not like those of other Gryllidae in either form or neuration. The hind legs
  are of peculiar structure, the tibiae terminating in two processes between which is situate a
  rudimentary tarsus. Near the extremity of the tibia there are some plates, forming two series,
  that can be adpressed to the tibia, or extended as shown in our figure. The body is terminated by
  four rather short, very mobile processes; the upper pair of these are each two-jointed, and are
  thought by de Saussure and Haase<a id="NtA_266" href="#Nt_266"><sup>[266]</sup></a> to be cerci;
  the inferior pair, being articulated processes of the anal segment, their presence in addition to
  cerci is remarkable. It is difficult to distinguish the sexes of this Insect.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The exotic genus <i>Rhipipteryx</i> is allied to <i>Tridactylus</i>. It is widely distributed
  in South America, but the little Insects that <span class="pagenum" id="page338"><span
  class="smaller">{338}</span></span>compose it are rare in collections, their saltatorial powers no
  doubt making it difficult to catch them; little is known as to their habits. In the undescribed
  Amazonian species we figure (Fig. 210), the wings, instead of being mere rudiments, as in
  <i>Tridactylus</i>, are elongate and project beyond the body; they are of a blue-black colour, and
  arranged so as to look as if they were the abdomen of the Insect; they, moreover, have a
  transverse pallid mark, giving rise to an appearance of division. It is difficult to form any
  surmise as to the nature of so curious a modification of the wings.</p>

  <p>The Tridactylides have no tympana on the legs, and their affinity with the Gryllidae is very
  doubtful. Dufour thought <i>T. variegatus</i> to be more allied to the Acridiidae. He based this
  opinion chiefly on some points of the internal anatomy, but pointed out that <i>Tridactylus</i>
  differs from the Acridiidae in having no air-sacs in the body.</p>

  <p>Not many of the Gryllidae are so peculiar as the forms we have mentioned. The family consists
  in larger part of Insects more or less similar to the common cricket, though exhibiting a great
  variety of external form. The common cricket of our houses, <i>Gryllus (Acheta) domesticus</i>
  (Fig. 204), has a very wide distribution in the Old World, and is also found in North America. It
  is believed to have had its natural distribution extended by commerce, though really nothing is
  known as to its original habitat. The shrill chirping of this little Insect is frequently heard at
  night in houses, even in the most densely inhabited parts of great cities. Neither the female nor
  the young are musical, yet the chirping may be heard at all seasons of the year, as young and
  adults coexist independent of season. The predilection of <i>Gryllus domesticus</i> for the
  habitations of man is very curious. The Insect is occasionally found out of doors in the
  neighbourhood of dwelling-houses in hot weather, but it does not appear that this species leads
  anywhere a truly wild life. It is fond of heat; though it rarely multiplies in dwelling-houses to
  any great extent, it is sometimes found in profusion in <span class="pagenum" id="page339"><span
  class="smaller">{339}</span></span>bake-houses. Usually the wings in the cricket are elongate, and
  project backwards from under the tegmina like an additional pair of cerci; a variety, however,
  occurs in which these tails are absent, owing to abbreviation of the wings.</p>

  <p>There is no beauty in the appearance of any of the Gryllidae, though many of them are very
  bizarre in shape. Very few of them venture to leave the surface of the earth to climb on plants.
  The species of <i>Oecanthus</i>, however, do so, and may be found sitting in flowers. They have a
  more Locustoid appearance than other Gryllidae. One of the most curious forms of the family is
  <i>Platyblemmus</i>, a genus of several species found in the Mediterranean region, the male of
  which has the head prolonged into a curious process (Fig. 211); this varies greatly in development
  in the males of the same species. It would seem that this organ is of a similar nature to the
  extraordinary structures we have figured in Locustidae (Fig. 189) and Mantidae (Fig. 136), though
  it appears impossible to treat the cephalic appendages of <i>Platyblemmus</i> as ornamental
  objects; their import is at present quite obscure.</p>

  <p>A curious form of variation occurs in this family, and is called micropterism by de Saussure;
  we have already mentioned its occurrence in the house-cricket. The hind wings, which are usually
  ample, and frequently have their extremities rolled up and protruding like cerci, are sometimes
  much smaller in size, and not visible till the tegmina are expanded. De Saussure at one time
  supposed these micropterous individuals to be distinct species; it is now, however, known that
  intermediate examples can be found by examining a great many specimens. Some species are always
  micropterous.</p>

  <p>In Britain we have only four representatives of the Gryllidae, viz. the mole-cricket, the
  house-cricket, and two field-crickets, one of which, <i>Nemobius sylvestris</i>, is considerably
  smaller than the house-cricket, while the other, <i>Gryllus campestris</i>, the true
  field-cricket, is a larger Insect. Its habits have been described in an interesting manner in
  Gilbert White's 88th letter. <span class="pagenum" id="page340"><span
  class="smaller">{340}</span></span>This Insect, like so many others, is apparently becoming rare
  in this country.</p>

  <p>A single fossil from the Lias has been described as belonging to the Gryllidae, but in the
  Tertiary strata a variety of members of the family have been discovered both in Europe and North
  America.</p>

  <p>The classification of Gryllidae is due to de Saussure,<a id="NtA_267"
  href="#Nt_267"><sup>[267]</sup></a> and is said by Brunner to be very natural. In the following
  synopsis of the tribes of crickets we give de Saussure's arrangement, except that we follow

  <p>The Neuroptera form a heterogeneous, though comparatively small, Order of Insects, including
  termites, stone-flies, dragon-flies, may-flies, caddis-flies, lace-wings, scorpion-flies,
  ant-lions, etc. Bird-lice are also included in Neuroptera, though they have no trace of wings.</p>

  <p>We treat the Order as composed of eleven distinct families, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page342"><span class="smaller">{342}</span></span>and, as a matter of convenience, arrange
  them in five divisions<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

    mammals. (Development very imperfectly known.) Fam. 1. Mallophaga.</p>
    <p>2. <i>Pseudoneuroptera</i>.&mdash;Insects with wings in adult life (in some cases wings are
    never acquired). The wings are developed in a visible manner outside the body. There is no
    definite pupa. Live entirely on land. Fam. 2. Embiidae; 3. Termitidae; 4. Psocidae.</p>

    <p class="sp0">5. <i>Trichoptera</i>.&mdash;Development as in division 4. Mandibles absent in
    the adult Insect. Life aquatic in the early stages. Fam. 11. Phryganeidae.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The families we have enumerated in the preceding scheme are now generally adopted by
  entomologists. Great difference of opinion exists, however, as to the groups of greater value than
  the family, and for a long time past various schemes have been in vogue. Though it is necessary to
  allude to the more important of these systems, we can do so only in the briefest manner.</p>

  <p>Some of the families of Neuroptera are similar in many points of structure and development to
  Insects of other Orders; thus Termitidae are somewhat allied to Blattidae, Perlidae to Phasmidae
  in Orthoptera, while the Phryganeidae or Trichoptera make a considerable approach to Lepidoptera.
  Some naturalists&mdash;among whom we may mention Burmeister and Grassi&mdash;unite our Aptera,
  Orthoptera, and most of our Neuroptera into a single Order called Orthoptera. Others treat our
  Neuroptera as consisting of eight or nine distinct Orders; these, together with the names proposed
  for them, we have already alluded to in our chapter on classification, <span class="wnw">pp. <a
  href="#page171">171-177</a></span>.</p>

  <p>Erichson, impressed by the variety existing in Neuroptera, separated some of the groups into a
  sub-Order called Pseudoneuroptera; this sub-Order comprised our Termitidae, Psocidae, Ephemeridae,
  and Libellulidae. This division is still adopted in several treatises; the Pseudoneuroptera are
  indeed by some naturalists retained as an Order distinct from both Orthoptera <span
  class="pagenum" id="page343"><span class="smaller">{343}</span></span>and Neuroptera. Gerstaecker
  subsequently made use of a system somewhat different from that of Erichson, uniting the Perlidae,
  Ephemeridae, and Odonata into a group called <i>Orthoptera amphibiotica</i>, from which the
  Termitidae and Psocidae were excluded. The divisions we have here adopted differ but little from
  those of Gerstaecker, though we have arranged them in a very different manner. It is probable that
  not one-tenth part of the Neuroptera existing in the world have yet been examined by
  entomologists, and of those that are extant in collections, the life-histories and development are
  very imperfectly known. We have, therefore, not considered it wise to adopt a system that would
  involve great changes of nomenclature, while there can be little hope of its permanency.</p>

  <p><b>Fossils</b>.&mdash;When considering the subject of fossil Insects we briefly alluded to the
  discussions that have occurred as to whether the fossils of the palaeozoic period should be
  referred to existing Orders. Since the pages we allude to were printed, M. Brongniart's very
  important work<a id="NtA_269" href="#Nt_269"><sup>[269]</sup></a> on the Insects of that epoch has
  appeared. He considers that these ancient fossils may be classified with the existing Orders of
  Insects, though they cannot be placed in existing families; and he assigns the palaeozoic fossil
  Insects at present known, to the Orders Neuroptera and Orthoptera, and to the homopterous division
  of Hemiptera. The greater part of the species he looks on as Neuroptera, and places in six
  families&mdash;Megasecopterides, Protephemerides, Platypterides, Stenodictyopterides,
  Protodonates, and Protoperlides. Of these he considers the ancient Protephemerides, Protodonates,
  and Protoperlides as the precursors, which, we presume, we may interpret as the actual ancestors,
  of our existing Ephemeridae, Odonata, and Perlidae.</p>

  <p>Some of the fossils restored and described by the French entomologist are of great interest. We
  shall notice the Protephemerides, Protodonates, and Protoperlides in connexion with the families
  to which they are specially allied, and shall now only allude to the quite extinct families of
  Neuroptera, the Megasecopterides, Platypterides, and Stenodictyopterides.</p>

  <p>It is a peculiarity of these ancient Insects that they were much larger creatures than the
  corresponding forms that now exist. This may be due, to some extent, to the fact that tiny, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page344"><span class="smaller">{344}</span></span>fragile forms have not been
  preserved in the rocks, or have not attracted the attention of collectors; but as some of the
  palaeozoic Insects were absolutely the largest known&mdash;surpassing considerably in size any
  Insects at present existing&mdash;it is probable that, even if small forms existed at the remote
  epoch we are alluding to, the average size of the individual was greater than it is at present.
  The Megasecopterides of the carboniferous epoch were Insects of large size, with long, narrow
  wings, a small prothorax, and large meso- and meta-thorax, these two segments being equal in size;
  the abdomen was elongate and moderately voluminous, and was terminated by a pair of very elongate,
  slender filaments like those of the may-flies. The family includes several genera and species
  found at Commentry. One of these forms, <i>Corydaloides scudderi</i>, is of great interest, as it
  is believed by Brongniart that the imago possessed tracheal gills situated on the sides of the
  abdomen, analogous with those that exist at present in the immature condition of certain
  Ephemeridae. They are of interest in connexion with the gills found at the present time in the
  imagos of <i>Pteronarcys</i> (see <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page401">401</a></span>).
  Although these fossils are of such enormous antiquity, the tracheae can, M. Brongniart says, be
  still perceived in these processes.</p>

  <p>The Platypterides include also a considerable number of Insects of large size, with four large
  equal wings, frequently spotted or variegate. Some of these Insects were provided with expansions
  or lobes on the sides of the prothorax (Fig. 213); these are looked on as analogous to the
  expansions of meso- and meta-thorax, which are supposed by some writers to have been the rudiments
  from which wings were developed. These prothoracic wing-rudiments, if such they be, are said to
  have a system of nervures similar to what we find in true wings. The genus <i>Lithomantis</i>
  includes a Scotch fossil, and has already been mentioned by us on <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page259">259</a></span>.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The third family of extinct carboniferous Neuroptera is the Stenodictyopterides, in which
  Brongniart places the <i>Dictyoneura</i> of <span class="pagenum" id="page345"><span
  class="smaller">{345}</span></span>Goldenberg, the North American <i>Haplophlebium</i>, and
  several genera from Commentry. Some of them were very large Insects, with robust bodies, and
  possessed wing-like expansions on the prothorax, and lateral gill-like appendages on the sides of
  the abdomen.</p>

  <p>It is worthy of note that though so large a number of carboniferous Neuroptera have now been
  discovered, no larvae or immature forms have been found.</p>

  <p class="sp3">We now pass to the consideration of the divisions of Neuroptera still living.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Fam. I. Mallophaga</b>&mdash;<b>Bird-Lice or Biting Lice.</b></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Small Insects, wingless, with large head; thorax usually of two, rarely of one
    or three segments; prothorax always distinct; hind body consisting of eight to ten segments, in
    addition to the posterior two thoracic segments which usually are but little or not at all
    separated from it. The metamorphosis is very slight. The creatures live on the skins of birds or
    mammals, finding nourishment in the epidermal products.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>The whole of the Insects of this family live a parasitic, or rather epizoic, life. They all
  creep about those parts that are near to the skin, the feathers of birds or the hair of mammals;
  they rarely come quite to the surface, so that they are not detected on a superficial examination.
  It is curious that under these circumstances they should exhibit so great a variety of form and of
  anatomical characters as they do.</p>

  <p>They are very depressed, that is, flat, Insects, with a large head, which exhibits a great
  variety of shape; frequently it is provided in front of the antennae with some peculiar tubercles
  called trabeculae, which in some cases are mobile. The antennae are never large, frequently very
  small; they consist of from three to five joints, and are sometimes concealed in a cavity on the

  </div>

  <p>The eyes are very rudimentary, and consist of only a small number of isolated facets placed
  behind the antennae; sometimes they are completely absent. The mouth parts are situated entirely
  on the under-surface of the head and in a cavity. The upper lip is frequently of remarkable form,
  as if it were a scraping instrument (<i>ol</i>, Fig. 215). The mandibles are sharply toothed and
  apparently act as cutting instruments. The maxillae have been described in the principal work on
  the family<a id="NtA_270" href="#Nt_270"><sup>[270]</sup></a> as possessing in some cases
  well-developed palpi. According to Grosse<a id="NtA_271" href="#Nt_271"><sup>[271]</sup></a> this
  is erroneous; the maxillae, he says, are always destitute of palpi, and are of peculiar form,
  being each merely a lobe of somewhat conical shape, furnished on one aspect with hooks or setae.
  The under lip is peculiar, and apparently of very different form in the two chief groups of
  Mallophaga. The large mentum bears, in Liotheides (Fig. 216, B), on each side a four-jointed
  palpus, the pair of palps being very widely separated; the ligula is broad and undivided; on each
  side there is a paraglossa bearing an oval process, and above this is a projection of the
  hypopharynx. In Philopterides (Fig. 216, A) the palpi are absent, and the parts of the lower lip
  are&mdash;with the exception of the paraglossae&mdash;but little differentiated. The lingua
  (hypo-pharynx) in Mallophaga is largely developed, <span class="pagenum" id="page347"><span
  class="smaller">{347}</span></span>and bears near the front a chitinous sclerite corresponding
  with another placed in the epipharynx.</p>

  <p>The prothorax in Mallophaga is a distinct division of the body even when the meso- and
  meta-thorax appear to be part of the abdomen. The mesothorax is frequently very small; it and the
  metathorax are sometimes intimately connected. In other cases (<i>Laemobothrium</i>) the
  metathorax appears to differ from the following abdominal segment only by having the third pair of
  legs attached to it. In <i>Trinoton</i> (Fig. 214) the three thoracic segments are well developed
  and distinct. The abdominal segments visible, vary in number from eight to ten; there is sometimes
  a difference according to sex, the male having one segment taken into the interior in connexion
  with the reproductive organs. The legs have short, broad coxae and small tarsi of one or two
  joints; very rarely three joints are present; there are either one or two claws; the legs with one
  claw being adapted for clinging to or clutching hairs. The front pair of legs is used not for
  locomotion so much as for grasping the food and bringing it within the range of the mouth. No
  trace of wings has been detected in any species.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The nervous system has been examined by Giebel in <i>Lipeurus bacillus</i>; there is a supra-
  and an infra-oesophageal ganglion, and three thoracic, but no abdominal ganglia. The
  supra-oesophageal is remarkably small, in fact not larger than the infra-oesophageal; it consists
  evidently of two conjoined halves. The alimentary canal has a slender, elongate oesophagus,
  dilated behind into a crop; this is frequently received between two cornua formed by the anterior
  part of the stomach, which, except for these, is simply tubular in form, though somewhat narrower
  at the posterior extremity. In some forms&mdash;Philopterides&mdash;the crop is of a very peculiar
  nature (Fig. 218), forming an abrupt paunch separated from the stomach by the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page348"><span class="smaller">{348}</span></span>posterior portion of the
  oesophagus. There are only four Malpighian tubes; in some species the basal half of each tube is
  much dilated. The two divisions of the intestine are short and are separated by the intervention
  of a glandular girdle. Salivary glands exist; Giebel figures what we may consider to be an
  enormous salivary reservoir as existing in <i>Menopon leucostomum</i>.</p>

  <p>The testes and ovaries are of a simple nature. The former consist of two or three capsules,
  each having a terminal thread; the vasa deferentia are tortuous and of variable length; they lead
  into the anterior part of the ejaculatory duct, where also opens the elongate duct proceeding from
  the bicapsular vesicula seminalis; these structures have been figured by Grosse<a id="NtA_272"
  href="#Nt_272"><sup>[272]</sup></a> as well as by Giebel. The ovaries consist of three to five
  short egg-tubes on each side; the two oviducts combine to form a short common duct with which
  there is connected a receptaculum seminis.</p>

  micropyle-apparatus, and at the opposite pole are provided with seta-like appendages. They are
  very like the eggs of the true lice, and are said in some cases to be suspended by threads to the
  hairs or feathers after the fashion of the eggs of Pediculi.</p>

  <p>Little is known as to the development; the young are extremely like the adult, and are thought
  to moult frequently; the duration of life is quite unknown.</p>

  <p>It has been stated by some writers that the mouth is truly of the sucking kind, and that the
  Mallophaga feed on the blood of their hosts. This is, however, erroneous; they eat the delicate
  portions of the feathers of birds, and of mammals perhaps the young hair. Their fertility is but
  small, and it is believed that <span class="pagenum" id="page349"><span
  class="smaller">{349}</span></span>in a state of nature they are very rarely an annoyance to their
  hosts. The majority of the known species live on birds; the forms that frequent mammals are less
  varied and have been less studied; most of them have only one claw to the feet (Fig. 220), while
  the greater portion of the avicolous species have two claws.</p>

  <p>Most of the forms have the anterior legs small, and they are usually drawn towards the mouth,
  owing, it is believed, to their being used after the manner of hands to bring the food to the
  mouth; hence in some of our figures (219, 220) the body looks as if it had only four legs.</p>

  <p>Very diverse statements have been made as to whether allied forms of Mallophaga are found only
  on allied birds. It would appear that this is the case only to a limited extent, as certain
  species are found on quite a variety of birds; moreover, some birds harbour several species of
  bird-lice, even five genera having been found, it is said, on one species of bird. <i>Docophorus
  icterodes</i> has been recorded as occurring on many kinds of ducks and geese; the swan, however,
  harbours a distinct species, <i>Docophorus cygni</i>, and this is said to have also been found on
  the bean-goose.</p>

  <p>At least five species, belonging to three distinct genera, have been found on the common fowl.
  The parasite most frequently met with on this valuable creature is <i>Menopon pallidum</i> (Fig.
  <span class="pagenum" id="page350"><span class="smaller">{350}</span></span>221), which is said to
  have been figured by Redi two hundred years ago under the name of <i>Pulex capi</i>. This species
  multiplies to a considerable extent; it is of very active habits, and passes readily from one bird
  to another, so that it is found on other species besides the domestic fowl. It is even said that
  horses kept near hen-roosts have been seriously troubled by <i>Menopon pallidum</i>, but it is
  suggested by Osborn that these attacks may perhaps have been really due to itch-mites. There is,
  however, no doubt that this species may infest poultry, especially if sickly, to an enormous
  extent. The dust-baths in which poultry are so fond of indulging are considered to be of great use
  in keeping down the numbers of this Insect.</p>

  <p>A table of the birds and mammals on which Mallophaga have been found, together with the names
  of the latter, has been given by Giebel.<a id="NtA_274" href="#Nt_274"><sup>[274]</sup></a> The
  classification of the group, so far as the principal divisions are concerned, by no means accords
  with the kind of animals that serve as hosts, for the only two genera peculiar to quadrupeds
  (<i>Trichodectes</i>, Fig. 220; and <i>Gyropus</i>) belong to the two chief divisions of
  Mallophaga. The genus <i>Menopon</i> includes numerous species found on birds, and three or four
  others peculiar to mammals.</p>

  <p>Two very natural divisions, Philopterides and Liotheides, were adopted by Giebel and Nitzsch,
  but unfortunately the chief character they made use of for diagnosing the two groups&mdash;the
  presence or absence of maxillary palpi&mdash;was illusory. Apparently the labial palps will serve
  the purpose of distinguishing the two divisions, they being present in the Liotheides and absent
  in the Philopterides. A table of the characters of the avicolous genera of these two groups is
  given by Grosse.<a id="NtA_275" href="#Nt_275"><sup>[275]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Liotheides are more active Insects, and leave their host after its death to seek another.
  But the Philopterides do not do so, and die in about three days after the death of their host.
  Possibly Mallophaga may be transferred from one bird to another <span class="pagenum"
  id="page351"><span class="smaller">{351}</span></span>by means of the parasitic two-winged flies
  that infest birds. The writer has recorded<a id="NtA_276" href="#Nt_276"><sup>[276]</sup></a> a
  case in which a specimen of one of these bird-flies captured on the wing was found to have some

  <p class="sp3">We should perhaps point out that these Mallophaga, though called bird-lice, have
  nothing to do with the true lice which are so frequently found with them, and that live by sucking
  the blood of their hosts. It would in fact be better to drop the name of bird-lice altogether, and
  call the Mallophaga biting lice. <i>Trichodectes latus</i>, according to this method, would be
  known as the biting louse of the dog, the true or sucking louse of which animal is <i>Haematopinus
  piliferus</i>, and belongs to the anoplurous division of Hemiptera.</p>

  <p>The Embiidae are one of the smallest families of Insects; not more than twenty species are
  known from all parts of the world, and it is probable that only a few hundred actually exist. They
  are small and feeble Insects of unattractive appearance, and shrivel so much after death as to
  render it difficult to ascertain their characters. They require a warm climate. Hence <span
  class="pagenum" id="page352"><span class="smaller">{352}</span></span>it is not a matter for

  <p>The simple antennae are formed of numerous joints, probably varying in number from about
  fifteen to twenty-four. The mouth is mandibulate. Chatin states<a id="NtA_277"
  href="#Nt_277"><sup>[277]</sup></a> that the pieces homologous with those of a maxilla can be
  detected in the mandible of <i>Embia</i>. The labium is divided. The legs are inserted at the
  sides of the body, the coxae are widely separated (Fig. 223), the hind pair being, however, more
  approximate than the others. The abdomen is simple and cylindrical, consisting of ten segments,
  the last of which bears a pair of biarticulate cerci. In the male sex there is a slight asymmetry
  of these cerci and of the terminal segment. The thorax is remarkable on account of the equal
  development of the meso- and meta-thorax and their elongation in comparison to the prothorax. When
  they bear wings there is no modification or combination of the segments for the purposes of
  flight, the condition of these parts being, even then, that of wingless Insects; so that the
  Embiidae that have wings may be described as apterous-like Insects provided with two pairs of
  inefficient wings. The wings are inserted on a small space at the front part of each of the
  segments to which they are attached. The legs have three-jointed tarsi, and are destitute of a
  terminal appendage between the claws.</p>

  <p>The wings in Embiidae are very peculiar; they are extremely <span class="pagenum"
  id="page353"><span class="smaller">{353}</span></span>flimsy, and the nervures are ill-developed;
  stripes of a darker brownish colour alternate with pallid spaces. We figure the anterior wing of
  <i>Oligotoma saundersii</i>, after Wood-Mason; but should remark that the neuration is really less
  definite than is shown in these figures; the lower one represents Wood-Mason's interpretation of
  the nervures. He considers<a id="NtA_278" href="#Nt_278"><sup>[278]</sup></a> that the brown bands
  "mark the original courses of veins which have long since disappeared." A similar view is taken by
  Redtenbacher,<a id="NtA_279" href="#Nt_279"><sup>[279]</sup></a> but at present it rests on no
  positive evidence.</p>

  <p>One of the most curious features of the external structure is the complex condition of the
  thoracic sternal sclerites. These are shown in Fig. 223, representing the under-surface of an
  <i>Embia</i> of uncertain species recently brought by Mr. Bateson from Andalusia.</p>

  <p>According to Grassi<a id="NtA_280" href="#Nt_280"><sup>[280]</sup></a> there are ten pairs of
  stigmata, two thoracic and eight abdominal; these are connected by longitudinal and transverse
  tracheae into a single system. The ganglia of the ventral chain are, one suboesophageal, three
  thoracic, and seven abdominal; these are segmentally placed, except that there is no ganglion in
  the fifth abdominal segment. There is a stomato-gastric system but no "sympathetic." Salivary
  glands are present. The stomodaeal portions of the alimentary canal are remarkably capacious; the
  stomach is elongate and slender, without diverticula; the Malpighian tubes are elongate and
  slender; they vary in number with the age of the individual, attaining that of twenty in the
  adult. The ovaries are arranged somewhat after the fashion of those of <i>Japyx</i>, there being
  in each five short egg-tubes, opening at equal intervals into a straight duct. The testes are
  remarkably large; each one consists of five masses of lobules, and has a large vesicula seminalis,
  into the posterior part of which there open the ducts of two accessory glands. The large joint of
  the front tarsus includes glands whose secretion escapes by orifices at the tips of certain setae
  interspersed between the short spines that are placed on the sole.</p>

  <p>Species of this genus occur in the Mediterranean region, but their characters have not yet been
  examined. Our information <span class="pagenum" id="page354"><span
  class="smaller">{354}</span></span>as to these is chiefly to be found in Grassi's work. The two
  species studied by him were wingless. They live under stones, where they spin webs by means of the
  front feet, whose first joint is, as we have said, enlarged and contains glands; the Insect uses
  the webs as a means of support in progression, acting on them by means of papillae and a comb-like
  structure placed on the four posterior feet.</p>

  <p>Grassi informs us that these Insects are not uncommon under stones in Catania; they require
  moisture as well as warmth, but not too much; sometimes there is only one individual found under a
  stone, at others eight or ten. In the winter and spring their galleries are found on the surface
  of the earth, but in the hot months of summer they secure the requisite amount of moisture by
  sinking their galleries to the depth of ten or fifteen centimetres. Their food consists chiefly of
  vegetable matter. They may be reared with ease in glass vessels. Other species of the family
  attain wings; the details of the process are not well known. <i>Oligotoma michaeli</i> (Fig. 222)
  was discovered in a hothouse in London among some orchid roots brought from India, and was found
  in more than one stage of development; the young greatly resemble the adult, except in the absence
  of wings. A nymph-form is described by M&lsquo;Lachlan<a id="NtA_281"
  href="#Nt_281"><sup>[281]</sup></a> as possessing wings of intermediate length, and Hagen has
  suggested that this supposed nymph is really an adult female with short wings. If this latter view
  be correct, nothing is known as to the mode of development of wings in the family. It is still
  uncertain whether female Embiidae ever possess wings. Wood-Mason and Grassi have shown that there
  are wingless females in some species, and we know that there are winged males in others, but what
  the usual relation of the sexes may be in this respect is quite uncertain. These Insects have been
  detected in various parts of the world. In the Sandwich Islands <i>Oligotoma insularis</i> was
  discovered by the Rev. T. Blackburn in the wood and thatch forming the roofs of natives' houses. A
  species has been found in Prussian amber, and Grassi thinks that <i>Embia solieri</i>&mdash;one of
  the Mediterranean species&mdash;is not to be distinguished with certainty from the Insect found in
  amber.</p>

  <p>Embiidae still remains one of the most enigmatic of the families of Insects. Although Grassi's
  recent observations are <span class="pagenum" id="page355"><span
  class="smaller">{355}</span></span>of great value from an anatomical point of view, they rather
  add to, than diminish, the difficulties we encounter in endeavouring to understand the lives of
  these obscure creatures. That Embiidae form webs has long been known, and it was thought by some
  that the webs, like those of spiders, might be of assistance in procuring food. We may, however,
  infer from Grassi's observations that this is not the case, but that the silken tunnels or
  galleries&mdash;as he calls them&mdash;serve chiefly as a means of locomotion and protection, the
  feet of the Insects being highly modified in conformity with this mode of life. Grassi seems to be
  of opinion that the galleries are also useful in preserving a proper degree of humidity round the
  Insects. We have already alluded to the mystery that surrounds the mode of growth of their wings.
  Nearly all that is known as to the Embiidae is contained in Grassi's paper, or is referred to in
  Hagen's monograph of the family.<a id="NtA_282" href="#Nt_282"><sup>[282]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="sp5">Considerable difference of opinion has prevailed as to the allies of these obscure
  Insects. It would seem that they are most nearly allied to Termitidae and Psocidae. Grassi,
  however, considers these affinities only remote, and suggests that Embiidae should form a separate
  Order, to be placed in a super-Order Orthoptera, which would include our Aptera, the two families
  mentioned above, Mallophaga, Embiidae, and the ordinary Orthoptera. Brauer places the family in
  his Orthoptera genuina.</p>

  <p>The term White Ants has been so long in use for the Termitidae that it appears almost hopeless
  to replace it in popular use by another word. It has, however, always given rise to a great deal
  of confusion by leading people to suppose that white ants differ chiefly from ordinary ants by
  their colour. This is a most erroneous idea. There are scarcely any two divisions of Insects more
  different than the white ants and the ordinary ants. The two groups have little in common except
  that both have a social life, and that a very interesting analogy exists between the forms of the
  workers and soldiers of these two dissimilar Orders of Insects, giving rise to numerous analogies
  of habits. The word Termites&mdash;pronounced as two syllables&mdash;is a less objectionable name
  for these Insects than white ants.</p>

  <p>The integument in Termites is delicate, and the chitinous plates are never very hard;
  frequently they are so slightly developed that the creature appears to consist of a single
  membranous sac with creases in it, the head alone being very distinct. The head is exserted,
  frequently of large size, sometimes as large as all the rest of the body together. Termites may be
  quite blind, or possess facetted and simple eyes, the latter when present being two in number and
  always accompanied by facetted eyes. The antennae are simple, consisting of from nine to
  thirty-one joints, which differ but little from one another; the number in each individual
  increases as the development progresses. The parts of the mouth are large, the ligula consists of
  one piece (Fig. 226, A), but often has the appearance of being formed by two united pieces; on its
  extremity are seated two pairs of lobes.</p>

  <p>The head is articulated to the thorax by means of two very large cervical sclerites on each
  side, placed at right angles to one another, and visible on the under-surface. The prothorax is
  well developed and distinct from the parts behind it. The <span class="pagenum" id="page358"><span
  class="smaller">{358}</span></span>pronotum, of variable form and size, is very distinct in the
  perfect Insects; with it are connected the largely developed pleura. The episternum is very
  peculiar, consisting of an elongate chitinous slip on each side hanging downwards, the two not
  quite meeting in the middle; they thus form the margin of the very large anterior orifice, and are
  in contiguity with the cervical sclerites; behind them are the very large epimera. The prosternum
  appears to be usually entirely membranous; in some cases the sclerite in it is small and delicate,
  and apparently differs according to the species. The meso- and meta-thorax are sub-equal in size;
  the mesosternum forms a peculiar, large, adpressed fold. The metasternum is membranous, but is
  terminated behind by a sclerite apparently of variable form. The hind body is voluminous, simple
  in form, consisting of ten segments and bearing at the extremity two short distant cerci of a
  variable number of joints. The terminal ventral sclerites differ greatly in form according to the
  species and sometimes according to the sex; there are sometimes, if not always, present near the
  extremity two peculiar minute biarticulate styles, called appendices anales. The coxae are all
  large, free, and exserted; at the base of each is a transverse trochantin. The femora are
  articulated with the trochanters, not with the coxae; both femora and tibiae are slender, the
  tarsi small, four-jointed; the terminal joint elongate.</p>

  <p>It is now well established that Termites have a means of communication by sounds. The
  individuals have a peculiar way of jerking themselves, as has been frequently noticed by observers
  of the Insects; these convulsive movements may possibly be connected with the production of sound,
  which may perhaps be evoked by contact between the back of the head and the pronotum; the exact
  mode by which the sounds are produced is not, however, known. The existence of an auditory organ
  in the front tibia has been demonstrated by Fritz M&uuml;ller,<a id="NtA_283"

  </div>

  <p>The wings of Termitidae are not like those of any other Insects; their neuration is very
  simple, but nevertheless the wings of the different forms exhibit great differences in the extent
  to which they are made up of the various fields. This is shown in Fig. 228, where the homologous
  nervures are numbered according to the systems of both Hagen and Redtenbacher. The area, VII, that
  forms the larger part of the wing in C, corresponds to the small portion at the base of the wing
  in B. The most remarkable feature of the wing is, however, its division into two parts by a suture
  or line of weakness near the base, as shown in Fig. 225. The wings are used only for a single
  flight, and are then shed by detachment at this suture; the small basal portion of each of the
  four wings is horny and remains attached to the Insect, serving as a protection to the dorsal
  surface of the thorax.</p>

  <p>The nature of the suture that enables the Termites to cast their wings with such ease after
  swarming is not yet understood. There are no true transverse veinlets or nervules in Termites.
  Redtenbacher suggests<a id="NtA_284" href="#Nt_284"><sup>[284]</sup></a> that the transverse
  division of the wing at its base, as shown in Fig. 225, along which the separation of the wing
  occurs at its falling off, may have arisen from a coalescence of the subcostal vein with the
  eighth concave vein of such a wing as that of Blattidae. The same authority also informs us that
  the only point of resemblance between the wings of Termitidae and those of Psocidae is that both
  have an unusually small number of concave veins.</p>

  <p>The information that exists as to the internal anatomy of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page360"><span class="smaller">{360}</span></span>Termites is imperfect, and refers, moreover,
  to different species; it would appear that considerable diversity exists in many respects, but on
  this point it would be premature to generalise. What we know as to the respiratory system is
  chiefly due to F. M&uuml;ller.<a id="NtA_285" href="#Nt_285"><sup>[285]</sup></a> The number of
  spiracles is ten; Hagen says three thoracic and seven abdominal, M&uuml;ller two thoracic and eight
  abdominal. In fertile queens there usually exist only six abdominal stigmata. There is good reason
  for supposing that the respiratory system undergoes much change correlative with the development
  of the individual; it has been suggested that the supply of tracheae to the sexual organs is
  deficient where there is arrest of development of the latter.</p>

  <p>The alimentary canal is only of moderate length.  Salivary glands exist, as also do salivary
  reservoirs; these latter are large, in some species remarkably so. The oesophagus is slender, but
  abruptly enlarged behind to form a large crop; a proventriculus is apparently either present or
  absent; the chylific ventricle, or stomach, is slender and simple. The Malpighian tubules are very
  long; their number is probably from four to eight in the adult, and in the earlier stages less.
  Behind the tubes the alimentary canal forms a large paunch, and after this there is a small
  intestine and rectum. The paunch is a peculiar structure, and probably of great importance in the
  economy of Termites.</p>

  <p>These creatures emit minute quantities of a secretion that is corrosive, and can act on metal
  and even glass;<a id="NtA_286" href="#Nt_286"><sup>[286]</sup></a> its nature and source are not
  understood. Hagen describes peculiar structures in the rectum to which he is inclined<a
  id="NtA_287" href="#Nt_287"><sup>[287]</sup></a> to ascribe the origin of this substance, but this
  is very uncertain.</p>

  <p>The brain is small; the infra-oesophageal ganglion is placed <span class="pagenum"
  id="page361"><span class="smaller">{361}</span></span>immediately under the supra-oesophageal;
  there are three thoracic and six abdominal ganglia. The nervous system apparently differs but
  little in the various forms, or in the different stages of life, except that in the fertile
  females the abdominal ganglia become so much enlarged that they even exceed the brain in size.</p>

  <p>The testes are unusually simple; each consists of eight capsules opening into the vas deferens;
  the two vasa converge and are continued as a short ejaculatory duct; at the point of convergence
  there is a pair of curled vesiculae seminales.</p>

  <p>The ovarian system is also simple; there is a variable number of elongate egg-tubes, each of
  which opens separately into the oviduct; the two ducts unite to form a short uterus, on which
  there is placed first a spermatheca, and near the extremity a convolute tubular sebific gland. The
  number of egg-tubes is subject to extraordinary variation, according to the species, and according
  to the age of the fertilised individual.</p>

  <p><b>Social Life.</b>&mdash;Termites live in communities that consist sometimes of enormous
  numbers of individuals. The adult forms found in a community are (1) workers; (2) soldiers; (3)
  winged males and females; (4) some of these winged forms that have lost their wings. Some species
  have no worker caste. The individuals of the third category are only present for a few days and
  then leave the nest in swarms. In addition to the adult individuals there are also present various
  forms of young. The individuals that have lost their wings are usually limited to a single pair,
  king and queen; there may be more than one king and queen, but this is not usual. The king and
  queen may be recognised by the stumps of their cast wings, which exist in the form of small
  triangular pieces folded on the back of the thorax (Fig. 235). The continuance of the community is
  effected entirely by the royal pair; they are the centres of activity of the community, which is
  thrown into disorder when anything happens to them. Usually the pair are physically incapable of
  leaving the nest, especially the queen, and frequently they are enclosed in a cell which they
  cannot leave. In consequence of the disorganisation that arises in the community in the absence of
  a royal pair, Termites keep certain individuals in such a state of advancement that they can
  rapidly be developed into royalties should occasion require it. These reserve individuals are
  called complementary by Grassi; when <span class="pagenum" id="page362"><span
  class="smaller">{362}</span></span>they become royalties they are usually immature as regards the
  condition of the anterior parts of the body, and are then called by Grassi and others neoteinic,
  as is more fully explained on <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page380">380</a></span>.</p>

  <p><b>Swarms.</b>&mdash;As a result of the Termite economy large numbers of superfluous
  individuals are frequently produced; these, in the winged state, leave the community, forming
  swarms which are sometimes of enormous extent, and are eagerly preyed on by a variety of animals
  including even man. Hagen has given particulars<a id="NtA_288" href="#Nt_288"><sup>[288]</sup></a>
  of a swarm of <i>T. flavipes</i> in Massachusetts, where the Insects formed a dark cloud; they
  were accompanied by no less than fifteen species of birds, some of which so gorged themselves that
  they could not close their beaks.</p>

  <p>There is but little metamorphosis in Termitidae. Young Termites are very soft; they have a thin
  skin, a disproportionately large head, and are of a peculiar white colour as if filled with milk.
  This condition of milkiness they retain, notwithstanding the changes of form that may occur during
  their growth, until they are adult. The wings first appear in the form of prolongations of the
  meso- and meta-nota, which increase in size, the increment probably taking place at the moults.
  The number of joints of the antennae increases during the development; it is effected by growth of
  the third joint and subsequent division thereof; hence the joints immediately beyond the second
  are younger than the others, and are usually shorter and altogether more imperfect. The
  life-histories of Termites have been by no means completely followed; a fact we can well
  understand when we recollect that these creatures live in communities concealed from observation,
  and that an isolated individual cannot thrive; besides this the growth is, for Insects, unusually
  slow.</p>

  <p><b>Natural History.</b>&mdash;The progress of knowledge as to Termites has shown that profound
  differences exist in the economy of different species, so that no fair general idea of their lives
  can be gathered from one species. We will therefore briefly sketch the economy, so far as it has
  been ascertained, in three species, viz. <i>Calotermes flavicollis</i>, <i>Termes lucifugus</i>,
  and <i>T. bellicosus</i>.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Calotermes flavicollis</i> inhabits the neighbourhood of the Mediterranean Sea; it is a
  representative of a large series of species in which the peculiarities of Termite life are
  exhibited in a comparatively simple manner. There is no special caste of workers, consequently
  such work as is done is carried on by the other members of the community, viz. soldiers, and the
  young and adolescent. The habits of this species have recently been studied in detail in Sicily by
  Grassi and Sandias.<a id="NtA_289" href="#Nt_289"><sup>[289]</sup></a> The Insects dwell in the
  branches and stems of decaying or even dead trees, where they nourish themselves on those parts of
  the wood in which the process of decay is not far advanced; they live in the interior of the
  stems, so that frequently no sign of them can be seen outside, even though they may be heard at
  work by applying the ear to a branch. They form no special habitation, the interior of the branch
  being sufficient protection, but they excavate or increase the natural cavities to suit their
  purposes. It is said that they line the galleries with proctodaeal cement; this is doubtful, but
  they form barricades and partitions where necessary, by cementing together the proctodaeal
  products with matter from the salivary glands or regurgitated from the anterior parts of the
  alimentary canal. The numbers of a community only increase slowly and remain always small; rarely
  do they reach 1000, and usually remain very much below this. The king and queen move about, and
  their family increases but slowly. After fifteen months of their union they may be surrounded by
  fifteen or twenty young; in another twelve months the number may have increased to fifty, and by
  the time it has reached some five hundred or upwards the increase ceases. This is due to the fact
  that the fertility of the queen is at first progressive, but ceases to be so. A queen three or
  four years old produces at the time of maximum production four to six eggs a day. When the
  community is small&mdash;during its first two years&mdash;the winged individuals that depart from
  it are about eight or ten annually, but the numbers of the swarm augment with the increase of the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page364"><span class="smaller">{364}</span></span>population. The growth
  of the individuals is slow; it appears that more than a year elapses between the hatching of the
  egg and the development of the winged Insect. The soldier may complete its development in less
  than a year; the duration of its life is not known; that of the kings and queens must be four or
  five years, probably more. After the winged Insects leave the colony they associate themselves in
  pairs, each of which should, if all goes well, start a new colony.</p>

  <p>The economy of <i>Termes lucifugus</i>, the only European Termite besides <i>Calotermes
  flavicollis</i>, has been studied by several observers, the most important of whom are Lesp&egrave;s<a
  id="NtA_290" href="#Nt_290"><sup>[290]</sup></a> and Grassi and Sandias. This species is much more
  advanced in social life than <i>Calotermes</i> is, and possesses both workers and soldiers (Fig.
  231, 2, 3); the individuals are much smaller than those of <i>Calotermes</i>. Burrows are made in
  wood of various kinds, furniture being sometimes attacked. Besides making excavations this species
  builds galleries, so that it can move from one object to another without being exposed; it being a
  rule&mdash;subject to certain exceptions&mdash;that Termites will not expose themselves in the
  outer air. This is probably due not only to the necessity for protection against enemies, but also
  to the fact that they cannot bear a dry atmosphere; if exposed to a drying air they speedily
  succumb. Occasionally specimens may be seen at large; Grassi considers these to be merely
  explorers. Owing to the extent of the colonies it is difficult to estimate with accuracy the
  number of individuals composing a community, but it is doubtless a great many thousands. Grassi
  finds the economy of this species in Sicily to be different from anything that has been recorded
  as occurring in other species; there is never a true royal pair. He says that during a period of
  six years he has examined thousands of nests without ever finding such a pair. In place thereof
  there are a considerable number of complementary queens&mdash;that is, females that have not gone
  through the full development to perfect Insects, but have been arrested in various stages of
  development. In Fig. 231, Nos. 4 and 5 show two of these abnormal royalties; No. 4 is
  comparatively juvenile in form, while No. 5 is an individual that has been substituted in an
  orphaned nest, and is nearer to the natural condition of perfect development. We have no
  information as to whether any <span class="pagenum" id="page365"><span
  class="smaller">{365}</span></span>development goes on in these individuals after the state of
  royalty is assumed, or whether the differences between these neoteinic queens are due to the state
  of development they may happen to be in when adopted as royalties. Kings are not usually present
  in these Sicilian nests; twice only has Grassi found a king, but he thinks that had he been able
  to search in the months of August and September he would then have found kings. It would appear
  therefore that the complementary kings die, or are killed after they have fertilised the females.
  Parthenogenesis is not thought to occur, as Grassi has found the spermathecae of the complementary
  queens to contain spermatozoa.</p>

  <p>The period of development apparently occupies from eighteen to twenty-three months. At
  intervals swarms of a great number of winged individuals leave the nest, and are usually promptly
  eaten up by various animals. After swarming, the wings are thrown off, and sometimes two specimens
  or three may be seen running off together; this has been supposed to be preliminary to pairing,
  but Grassi says this is not the case, but that the object is to obtain their favourite food, as we
  shall mention subsequently.</p>

  <p>Although these are the usual habits of <i>Termes lucifugus</i> at present in Sicily, it must
  not be concluded that they are invariable; we have in fact evidence to the contrary. Grassi has
  himself been able to procure in confinement a colony&mdash;or rather the commencement of
  one&mdash;accompanied by a true royal pair; while Perris has recorded<a id="NtA_291"
  href="#Nt_291"><sup>[291]</sup></a> that in the Landes he frequently found a royal pair of <i>T.
  lucifugus</i> under chips; they were accompanied in nearly every case by a few eggs. And Professor
  Perez has recently placed a winged pair of this species in a box with some wood, with the result
  that after some months a young colony has been founded. It appears probable therefore that this
  species at times establishes new colonies by means of royal pairs derived from winged individuals,
  but after their establishment maintains such colonies as long as possible by means of
  complementary queens. It is far from improbable that distinctions as to the use of true and
  complementary royalties may be to some extent due to climatic conditions. In some localities <i>T.
  lucifugus</i> has multiplied to such an extent as to be very injurious, while in others where it
  is found it has never been known to do so.</p>

  <p>The Termitidae of Africa are the most remarkable that have yet been discovered, and it is
  probably on that continent that the results of the Termitid economy have reached their climax. Our
  knowledge of the Termites of tropical Africa is chiefly due to Smeathman, who has described the
  habits of several species, among them <i>T. bellicosus</i>. It is more than a century since
  Smeathman travelled in Africa and read an account of the Termites to the Royal Society.<a
  id="NtA_292" href="#Nt_292"><sup>[292]</sup></a> His information was the first of any importance
  about Termitidae that was given to the world; it is, as may be well understood, deficient in many
  details, but is nevertheless of great value. Though his statements have been doubted they are
  truthful, and have been confirmed by Savage.<a id="NtA_293"

  <p><i>T. bellicosus</i> forms buildings comparable to human dwellings; some of them being twenty
  feet in height and of great solidity. In some parts of West Africa these nests were, in
  Smeathman's time, so numerous that they had the appearance of villages. Each nest was the centre
  of a community of countless numbers of individuals; subterranean passages extended from them in
  various directions. The variety of forms in one of these communities has not been well
  ascertained, but it would seem that the division of labour is carried to a great extent. The
  soldiers are fifteen times the size of the workers. The community is dependent on one royal
  couple. It is the opinion of the natives that if that couple perish so also does the community;
  and if this be correct we may conclude that this species has not a perfect system of replacing
  royal couples. The queen attains an almost incredible size and fertility. Smeathman noticed the
  great and gradual growth of the abdomen, and says it enlarges "to such an enormous size that an
  old queen will have it increased so as to be fifteen hundred or two thousand times the bulk of the
  rest of her body, and twenty or thirty thousand times the bulk of a labourer, as I have found by
  carefully weighing and computing the different states." He also describes the rate at which the
  eggs are produced, saying that there is a constant peristaltic movement<a id="NtA_294"
  href="#Nt_294"><sup>[294]</sup></a> of the abdomen, "so that one part or other alternately is
  rising and sinking in perpetual succession, and the matrix seems never at rest, but is always
  protruding eggs to the amount (as I have frequently counted in old queens) of sixty in a minute,
  or eighty thousand and upward in one day of twenty-four hours."</p>

  <p>This observer, after giving an account of the great swarms of perfect winged Insects that are
  produced by this species, and after describing the avidity with which they are devoured by the
  Hymenopterous ants and other creatures, adds: "I have discoursed with several gentlemen upon the
  taste of the white ants; and on comparing notes we have always agreed that they are most <span
  class="pagenum" id="page369"><span class="smaller">{369}</span></span>delicious and delicate
  eating. One gentleman compared them to sugared marrow, another to sugared cream and a paste of
  sweet almonds."</p>

  <p>From the preceding brief sketch of some Termitidae we may gather the chief points of importance
  in which they differ from other Insects, viz. (1) the existence in the community of
  individuals&mdash;workers and soldiers&mdash;which do not resemble their parents; (2) the
  limitation of the reproductive power to a single pair, or to a small number of individuals in each
  community, and the prolongation of the terminal period of life. There are other social Insects
  besides Termitidae: indeed, the majority of social Insects&mdash;ants, bees, and
  wasps&mdash;belong to the Order Hymenoptera, and it is interesting to note that analogous
  phenomena occur in them, but nevertheless with such great differences that the social life of
  Termites must be considered as totally distinct from that of the true ants and other social
  Hymenoptera.</p>

  <p><b>Development</b>.&mdash;Social Insects are very different to others not only in the fact of
  their living in society, but in respect of peculiarities in the mode of reproduction, and in the
  variety of habits displayed by members of a community. The greatest confusion has arisen in
  reference to Termitidae in consequence of the phenomena of their lives having been assumed to be
  similar to those of Hymenoptera; but the two cases are very different, Hymenoptera passing the
  early parts of their lives as helpless maggots, and then undergoing a sudden metamorphosis to a
  totally changed condition of structure, intelligence, and instinct.</p>

  <p>The development of what we may look on as the normal form of Termitidae&mdash;that is, the
  winged Insects male and female&mdash;is on the whole similar to that we have sketched in
  Orthoptera; the development in earwigs being perhaps the most similar. The individuals of
  Termitidae are, however, in the majority of cases if not in all, born without eyes; the
  wing-rudiments develop from the thoracic terga as shorter or longer lobes according to the degree
  of maturity; as in the earwigs the number of joints in the antennae increases as development
  advances. All the young are, when hatched, alike, the differences of caste appearing in the course
  of the subsequent development; the most important of these differences are those that result in
  the production of two special classes&mdash;only met with in social Insects&mdash;viz. worker and
  soldier. Of these the workers are individuals whose <span class="pagenum" id="page370"><span
  class="smaller">{370}</span></span>development is arrested, the sexual organs not going on to
  their full development, while other organs, such as the eyes, also remain undeveloped; the
  alimentary canal and its adjuncts occupy nearly the whole of the abdominal cavity. The adult
  worker greatly resembles&mdash;except in size&mdash;the young. Grassi considers that the worker is
  not a case of simple arrest of development, but that some deviation accompanies the arrest.</p>

  <p>The soldier also suffers an arrest of development in certain respects similar to the worker;
  but the soldier differs in the important fact that the arrest of the development of certain parts
  is correlative with an extraordinary development of the head, which ultimately differs greatly
  from those of either the worker or of the sexual males and females.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Soldier</b>.&mdash;All the parts of the head of the soldier undergo a greater or less change
  of form; even the pieces at its base, which connect it by means of the cervical sclerites with the
  prothorax, are altered. The parts that undergo the greatest modification are the mandibles (Fig.
  233, B); these become much enlarged in size and so much changed in form that in a great many
  species no resemblance to the original shape of these organs can be traced. It is a curious fact
  that the specific characters are better expressed in these superinduced modifications than they
  are in any other part of the organisation (except, perhaps, the wings). The soldiers are not alike
  in any two species of Termitidae so far as we know, and it seems impossible to ascribe the
  differences that exist between the soldiers of different species of Termitidae to special adaption
  for the work they have to perform. Such a suggestion is justifiable only in the case of the Nasuti
  (Fig. 234, 1), where the front of the head is prolonged into a point: a duct opens at the
  extremity of this point, from which is exuded a fluid that serves as a cement for <span
  class="pagenum" id="page371"><span class="smaller">{371}</span></span>constructing the nest, and
  is perhaps also used to disable enemies. Hence the prolongation and form of the head of these
  Nasuti may be fairly described as adaptation to useful ends. As regards the great variety
  exhibited by other soldiers&mdash;and their variety is much greater than it is in the
  Nasuti&mdash;it seems at present impossible to treat it as being cases of special adaptations for
  useful purposes. On the whole it would be more correct to say that the soldiers are very
  dissimilar in spite of their having to perform similar work, than to state that they are
  dissimilar in conformity with the different tasks they carry on.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Termite soldier is a phenomenon to which it is difficult to find a parallel among Insects.
  The soldier in the true ants is usually not definitely distinguished from the worker, but it is
  possible that in the leaf-cutting ants, the so-called soldier may prove to be more similar in its
  nature to the Termite soldier. The soldiers of any one species of Termite are apparently <span
  class="pagenum" id="page372"><span class="smaller">{372}</span></span>extremely similar to one
  another, and there are no intermediates between them and the other forms, except in the stages of
  differentiation. But we must recollect that but little is yet known of the full history of any
  Termite community, and it is possible that soldiers which in the stage of differentiation promise
  to be unsatisfactory may be killed and eaten,&mdash;indeed there is some evidence to this effect.
  There is too in certain cases some difference&mdash;larger or smaller size being the most
  important&mdash;between the soldiers of one species, which may possibly be due to the different
  stage of development at which their differentiation commenced.</p>

  <p>It would at present appear that, notwithstanding the remarkable difference in structure of the
  soldiers and workers of the white ants, there is not a corresponding difference of instinct. It is
  true that soldiers do more of certain things than workers do, and less of others, but this appears
  to be due solely to their possession of such very different structures; and we are repeatedly
  informed by Grassi that all the individuals in a community take part, so far as they are able, in
  any work that is going on, and we find also in the works of other writers accounts of soldiers
  performing acts that one would not have expected from them. The soldiers are not such effective
  combatants as the workers are. Dudley and Beaumont indeed describe the soldiers as merely looking
  on while the workers fight.<a id="NtA_295" href="#Nt_295"><sup>[295]</sup></a> So that we are
  entitled to conclude that the actions of the soldiers, in so far as they differ from those of the
  rest of the community, do so because of the different organisation and structures of these
  individuals. We shall, when speaking of food, point out that the condition of the soldier in
  relation to food and hunger is probably different from that of the other forms.</p>

  <p><b>Various Forms of a Community</b>.&mdash;The soldiers and workers are not the only anomalous
  forms found in Termitid communities; indeed on examining a large nest a variety of forms may be
  found that is almost bewildering. Tables have been drawn up by Grassi and others showing that as
  many as fifteen kinds may be found, and most of them may under certain circumstances coexist. Such
  tables do not represent the results of actual examination in any one case, and they by no means
  adequately represent the number that, according to the most recent observations of Grassi, may be
  present; but we give one taken <span class="pagenum" id="page373"><span
  class="smaller">{373}</span></span>from Grassi, as it conveys some idea of the numerous forms that
  exist in certain communities. In this table the arrangement, according to A, B, C, D, E,
  represents successive stages of the development<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Forms of Termes lucifugus</i>. (After Grassi.) <i>Zool. Anz.</i> xii. 1889, p.
  360.</p>

  <div class="ac w70x fcenter sp2">

    title="Embryonic&nbsp;layers" ></a>
  </div>

  <p>On inspecting this table it will be perceived that the variety of forms is due to three
  circumstances&mdash;(1) the existence of castes that are not present in ordinary Insects; (2) the
  coexistence of young, of adolescents, and of adults; and (3) the habit the Termites have of
  tampering with forms in their intermediate stages, the result of which may be the substitution of
  neoteinic individuals in place of winged forms.</p>

  <p>This latter procedure is far from being completely understood, but to it are probably due the
  various abnormal forms, such as soldiers with rudiments of wings, that have from time to time been
  discovered in Termite communities, and have given rise to much perplexity.</p>

  <p>In connexion with this subject we may call attention to the necessity, when examining Termite
  nests, of taking cognisance of the fact that more than one species may be present. Bates found
  different Termites living together in the Amazons Valley, and Mr. Haviland has found as many as
  five species of Termitidae and three of true ants in a single mound in South Africa. In this
  latter case observation showed that, though in such close proximity, there was but little further
  intimacy between the species. There are, however, true inquiline, or guest, Termites, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page374"><span class="smaller">{374}</span></span>of the genus
  <i>Eutermes</i>, found in various parts of the world living in the nests of other Termitidae.</p>

  <p><b>Origin of the Forms</b>.&mdash;The interest attaching to the various forms that exist in
  Termites, more particularly to the worker and soldier, is evident when we recollect that these
  never, so far as we know, produce young. In the social Hymenoptera it has been ascertained that
  the so-called neuters (which in these Insects are always females) can, and occasionally do,
  produce young, but in the case of the Termites it has never been suggested that the sexual organs
  of the workers and soldiers, whether male or female, ever become fruitful; moreover, the phenomena
  of the production of young by the white ants are of such a nature as to render it in the highest
  degree improbable that either workers or soldiers ever take any direct part in it. Now the soldier
  is extremely different from the sexual individuals that produce the young, and seeing that its
  peculiarities are not, in the ordinary sense of the word, hereditary, it must be of great interest
  to ascertain how they arise.</p>

  <p>Before stating the little information we possess on this subject, it is necessary to reiterate
  what we have already said to the effect that the soldiers and workers are not special to either
  sex, and that all the young are born alike. It would be very natural to interpret the phenomena by
  supposing the workers to be females arrested in their development&mdash;as is the case in social
  Hymenoptera&mdash;and by supposing the soldiers to be males with arrested and diverted
  development.</p>

  <p>The observations already made show that this is not the case. It has been thoroughly well
  ascertained by Lesp&egrave;s and Fritz M&uuml;ller that in various species of <i>Calotermes</i> the soldiers
  are both males and females. Lesp&egrave;s and Grassi have shown that the workers of <i>Termes
  lucifugus</i> are of male and female sex, and that this is also true of the soldiers. Although the
  view of the duality of the sexes of these forms was received at first with incredulity, it appears
  to be beyond doubt correct. Grassi adds that in all the individuals of the workers and soldiers of
  <i>Termes lucifugus</i> the sexual organs, either male or female, are present, and that they are
  in the same stage of development whatever the age of the individual. This statement of Grassi's is
  of importance because it seems to render improbable the view that the difference of form of the
  soldier and worker arises from the arrest of the <span class="pagenum" id="page375"><span
  class="smaller">{375}</span></span>development of their sexual organs at different periods. The
  fact that sex has nothing whatever to do with the determination of the form of workers and
  soldiers may be considered to be well established.</p>

  <p>The statement that the young are all born alike is much more difficult to substantiate. Bates
  said that the various forms could be detected in the new-born. His statement was made, however,
  merely from inspection of the nests of species about which nothing was previously known, and as it
  is then very difficult to decide that a specimen is newly hatched, it is probable that all he
  meant was that the distinction of workers, soldiers, and sexual forms existed in very small
  individuals&mdash;a statement that is no doubt correct. Other observers agree that the young are
  in appearance all alike when hatched, and Grassi reiterates his statement to this effect. Hence it
  would appear that the difference of form we are discussing arises from some treatment subsequent
  to hatching. It may be suggested, notwithstanding the fact that the young are apparently alike
  when hatched, that they are not really so, but that there are recondite differences which are in
  the course of development rendered conspicuous. This conclusion cannot at present be said with
  certainty to be out of the question, but it is rendered highly improbable by the fact ascertained
  by Grassi that a specimen that is already far advanced on the road to being an ordinary winged
  individual can be diverted from its evident destination and made into a soldier, the wings that
  were partially developed in such a case being afterwards more or less completely absorbed. This,
  as well as other facts observed by Grassi, render it probable that the young are truly, as well as
  apparently, born in a state undifferentiated except as regards sex. Fig. 230 (<span class="wnw">p.
  <a href="#page363">363</a></span>) is designed to illustrate Grassi's view as to this
  modification; the individual A is already far advanced in the direction of the winged form C, but
  can nevertheless be diverted by the Termites to form the adult soldier B.</p>

  <p>According to the facts we have stated, neither heredity nor sex nor arrest of development are
  the causes of the distinctions between worker and soldier, though some arrest of development is
  common to both; we are therefore obliged to attribute the distinction between them to other
  influences. Grassi has no hesitation in attributing the anatomical distinctions that arise between
  the soldiers, workers, and winged forms to alimentation. <span class="pagenum" id="page376"><span
  class="smaller">{376}</span></span>Food, or the mode of feeding, or both combined, are, according
  to the Italian naturalist, the source of all the distinctions, except those of sex, that we see in
  the forms of any one species of Termite.</p>

  <p><b>Feeding</b>.&mdash;Such knowledge as we possess of the food-habits of Termitidae is chiefly
  due to Grassi; it is of the very greatest importance, as giving a clue to much that was previously
  obscure in the Natural History of these extraordinary creatures.</p>

  <p>In the abodes of the Termites, notwithstanding the enormous numbers of individuals, cleanliness
  prevails; the mode by which it is attained appears to be that of eating all refuse matter. Hence
  the alimentary canal in Termitidae contains material of various conditions of nutritiveness. These
  Insects eat their cast skins and the dead bodies of individuals of the community; even the
  material that has passed through the alimentary canal is eaten again, until, as we may presume, it
  has no further nutritive power. The matter is then used for the construction of their habitations
  or galleries, or is carried to some unfrequented part of the nest, or is voided by the workers
  outside of the nests; the pellets of frass, <i>i.e.</i> alimentary rejectamenta, formed by the
  workers frequently betraying their presence in buildings when none of the Insects themselves are
  to be seen. The aliments of <i>Calotermes flavicollis</i> are stated by Grassi and Sandias to be
  as follows: (1) wood; (2) material passed from the posterior part of the alimentary canal or
  regurgitated from the anterior part; (3) the matter shed during the moults; (4) the bodies of
  other individuals; (5) the secretion of their own salivary glands or that of their fellows; (6)
  water. Of these the favourite food is the matter passed from the posterior part of the alimentary
  canal. We will speak of this as proctodaeal food. When a <i>Calotermes</i> wishes food it strokes
  the posterior part of another individual with the antennae and palpi, and the creature thus
  solicited yields, if it can, some proctodaeal food, which is then devoured. Yielding the
  proctodaeal food is apparently a reflex action, as it can be induced by friction and slight
  pressure of the abdomen with a small brush. The material yielded by the anterior part of the
  alimentary canal may be called stomodaeal product. It makes its appearance in the mouth in the
  form of a microscopic globule that goes on increasing in size till about one millimetre in
  diameter, when it is <span class="pagenum" id="page377"><span
  class="smaller">{377}</span></span>either used for building or as food for another individual. The
  mode of eating the ecdysial products has also been described by Grassi and Sandias. When an
  individual is sick or disabled it is frequently eaten alive. It would appear that the soldiers are
  great agents in this latter event, and it should be noticed that owing to their great heads and
  mandibles they can obtain food by other means only with difficulty. Since they are scarcely able
  to gnaw wood, or to obtain the proctodaeal and stomodaeal foods, their condition may be considered
  to be that of permanent hunger, only to be allayed by carnivorous proceedings. When thrown into a
  condition of excitement the soldiers sometimes exhibit a sort of Calotermiticidal mania,
  destroying with a few strokes five or six of their fellows. It is, however, only proper to say
  that these strokes are made at random, the creature having no eyes. The carnivorous propensities
  of <i>Calotermes</i> are apparently limited to cannibalism, as they slaughter other white ants
  (<i>Termes lucifugus</i>) but never eat them.</p>

  <p>The salivary food is white and of alkaline nature; when excreted it makes its appearance on the
  upper lip. It is used either by other individuals or by the specimen that produced it; in the
  latter case it is transferred to the lower lip and swallowed by several visible efforts of
  deglutition. The aliments we have mentioned are made use of to a greater or less extent by all the
  individuals except the very young; these are nourished only by saliva: they commence taking
  proctodaeal and stomodaeal food before they can eat triturated wood.</p>

  <p><b>Royal Pairs</b>.&mdash;The restriction of the reproductive powers of a community to a single
  pair (or to a very restricted number of individuals) occurs in all the forms of social Insects,
  and in all of them it is concomitant with a prolongation of the reproductive period far exceeding
  what is natural in Insects. We are not in a position at present to say to what extent the lives of
  the fertile females of Termitidae are prolonged, there being great difficulties in the way of
  observing these Insects for long periods owing to their mode of life; living, as they do,
  concealed from view, light and disturbance appear to be prejudicial to them. We have every reason
  to believe, however, that the prolongation extends as a rule over several years, and that it is
  much greater than that of the other individuals of the community, although the lives of even these
  latter are longer than is usual in Insects; but this <span class="pagenum" id="page378"><span
  class="smaller">{378}</span></span>point is not yet satisfactorily ascertained. As regards the
  males there is reason to think that considerable variety as to longevity prevails. But the belief
  is that the royal males of Termitidae also form an exception to other Insects in the prolongation
  of the terminal periods of their lives. In Hymenoptera, male individuals are profusely produced,
  but their lives are short, and their sole duty is the continuation of the species by a single act.
  We have seen that Grassi is of opinion that a similar condition of affairs exists at present with
  <i>Termes lucifugus</i> in Sicily, but with this exception it has always been considered that the
  life of the king Termite is, roughly speaking, contemporaneous with that of the queen; it is said
  that in certain species the king increases in bulk, though not to an extent that can be at all
  compared with the queen.</p>

  <p>It must be admitted that the duration of life of the king has not been sufficiently
  established, for the coexistence of a king with a queen in the royal cell is not inconsistent with
  the life of the king being short, and with his replacement by another. Much that is imaginary
  exists in the literature respecting Termites, and it is possible that the life of the king may
  prove to be not so prolonged as has been assumed.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Returning to the subject of the limitation of the reproduction of the community to a single
  pair, we may remark that <i>a priori</i> one would suppose such a limitation to be excessively
  unfavourable to the continuation of the species; and as it nevertheless is the fact that this
  feature is almost, if not quite, without exception <span class="pagenum" id="page379"><span
  class="smaller">{379}</span></span>in Insect societies, we may conclude that it is for some reason
  absolutely essential to Insect social life. It is true that there are in Termitidae certain
  partial exceptions, and these are so interesting that we may briefly note them. When a royal cell
  is opened it usually contains but a single female and male, and when a community in which royal
  cells are not used is inspected it is usually found that here also there are present only a single
  fertile female and a single king. Occasionally, however, it happens that numerous females are
  present, and it has been noticed that in such cases they are not fully matured females, but are
  imperfect, the condition of the wings and the form of the anterior parts of the body being that of
  adolescent, not adult Insects. It will be recollected that the activity of a community of Termites
  centres round the great fertility of the female; without her the whole community is, as Grassi
  graphically puts it, orphaned; and the observations of the Italian naturalist make it clear that
  these imperfect royalties are substitution queens, derived from specimens that have not undergone
  the natural development, but have been brought into use to meet the calamity of orphanage of the
  community. The Termites apparently have the power of either checking or stimulating the
  reproductive organs apart from other organs of the body, and they appear to keep a certain number
  of individuals in such a condition that in case of anything going wrong with the queen, the
  reserves may be brought as soon as possible into a state of reproductive activity. The individuals
  that are in such a condition that they can become pseudo-royalties are called complementary or
  reserve royalties, and when actually brought into use they become substitution royalties. It is
  not at present quite clear why the substitution royalties should be in such excess of numbers as
  we have stated they were in the case we have figured (Fig. 236), but it may be due to the fact
  that when the power of the community is at a certain capacity for supporting young a single
  substitution royalty would not supply the requisite producing power, and consequently the
  community adopts a greater number of the substitution forms. Termites are utterly regardless of
  the individual lives of the members of the community, and when the reproductive powers of the
  company of substitution royalties become too great, then their number is reduced by the effective
  method of killing and eating them.</p>

  <p>According to Grassi's observations, the communities of <i>Termes <span class="pagenum"
  id="page380"><span class="smaller">{380}</span></span>lucifugus</i> are now kept up in Sicily
  almost entirely by substitution royalties; the inference being that the age of each community has
  gone beyond the capacity for life of any single royal queen.</p>

  <p>The substitution royalties are, as we have said, called neoteinic (<span title="neos"
  class="fsn">&nu;&epsilon;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, youthful, <span title="tein&ocirc;"
  class="fsn">&tau;&epsilon;&#x03AF;&nu;&omega;</span>, to belong to), because, though they carry on
  the functions of adult Insects, they retain the juvenile condition in certain respects, and
  ultimately die without having completed the normal development. The phenomenon is not quite
  peculiar to Insects, but occurs in some other animals having a well-marked metamorphosis, notably
  in the Mexican Axolotl.<a id="NtA_296" href="#Nt_296"><sup>[296]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      the royal chamber of <i>Termes</i> sp. at Singapore by Mr. G. D. Haviland. The queen was one
      of thirteen, all in a nearly similar state. <b>A</b>, king; <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, queen.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>A point of great importance in connexion with the neoteinic royalties is that they are not
  obtained from the instar immediately preceding the adult state, but are made from Insects in an
  earlier stage of development. The condition immediately preceding the adult state is that of a
  nymph with long wing-pads; such specimens are not made into neoteinic royalties, but nymphs of an
  earlier stage, or even larvae, are preferred. It is apparently by an interference with one of
  these earlier stages of development that the "nymphs of the second form," which have for long been
  an enigma to zoologists, are produced.</p>

  <p><b>Post-metamorphic Growth.</b>&mdash;The increase of the fertility of the royal female is
  accompanied by remarkable phenomena of growth. Post-metamorphic growth is a phenomenon almost
  unknown in Insect life, except in these Termitidae; distension not infrequently occurs to a
  certain extent in other Insects, and <span class="pagenum" id="page381"><span
  class="smaller">{381}</span></span>is usually due to the growth of eggs inside the body, or to the
  repletion of other parts. But in Termitidae there exists post-metamorphic growth of an extensive
  and complex nature; this growth does not affect the sclerites (<i>i.e.</i> the hard chitinous
  parts of the exo-skeleton), which remain of the size they were when the post-metamorphic growth
  commenced, and are consequently mere islands in the distended abdomen (Fig. 236, B, C). The growth
  is chiefly due to a great increase in number and size of the egg-tubes, but there is believed to
  be a correlative increase of various other parts of the abdominal as distinguished from the
  anterior regions of the body. A sketch of the distinctions existing between a female of a species
  at the time of completion of the metamorphosis and at the period of maximum fertility does not
  appear to have been yet made.</p>

  <p><b>New Communities.</b>&mdash;The progress of knowledge in respect of Termitidae is bringing to
  light a quite unexpected diversity of habits and constitution. Hence it is premature to generalise
  on important matters, but we may refer to certain points that have been ascertained in connexion
  with the formation of new communities. The duration of particular communities and the modes in
  which new ones are founded are still very obscure. It was formerly considered that swarming took
  place in order to increase the number of communities, and likewise for promoting crossing between
  the individuals of different communities. Grassi, however, finds as the result of his prolonged
  observations on <i>Termes lucifugus</i> that the swarms have no further result than that the
  individuals composing them are eaten up. And Fritz M&uuml;ller states<a id="NtA_297"
  href="#Nt_297"><sup>[297]</sup></a> that in the case of the great majority of forms known to him
  the founding of a colony by means of a pair from a swarm would be just about as practicable as to
  establish a new colony of human beings by placing a couple of newly-born babes on an uninhabited
  island. It was also thought that pairs, after swarming, re-entered the nests and became royal
  couples. It does not, however, appear that any one is able to produce evidence of such an
  occurrence. The account given by Smeathman of the election of a royal couple of <i>Termes
  bellicosus</i> is imperfect, as, indeed, has already been pointed out by Hagen. It suggests,
  however, that a winged pair after leaving the nest do again enter it to become king <span
  class="pagenum" id="page382"><span class="smaller">{382}</span></span>and queen. The huge edifices
  of this species described by Smeathman are clearly the result of many years of labour, and at
  present substitution royalties are not known to occur in them, so that it is not improbable
  Smeathman may prove to be correct even on this point, and that in the case of some species mature
  individuals may re-enter the nest after swarming and may become royal couples. On the whole,
  however, it appears probable that communities of long standing are kept up by the substitution
  royalty system, and that new communities when established are usually founded by a pair from a
  swarm, which at first are not in that completely helpless condition to which they come when they
  afterwards reach the state of so-called royalty. Grassi's observations as to the sources of food
  remove in fact one of the difficulties that existed previously in regard to the founding of new
  colonies, for we now know that a couple may possibly bear with them a sufficient supply of
  proctodaeal and stomodaeal aliment to last them till workers are hatched to feed them, and till
  soldiers are developed and the community gradually assumes a complex condition. Professor Perez
  has recently obtained<a id="NtA_298" href="#Nt_298"><sup>[298]</sup></a> the early stages of a
  community from a winged pair after they had been placed in captivity, unattended by workers.
  M&uuml;ller's observation, previously quoted, is no doubt correct in relation to the complete
  helplessness of royal pairs after they have been such for some time; but that helplessness is
  itself only gradually acquired by the royal pair, who at first are able to shift for themselves,
  and produce a few workers without any assistance.</p>

  <p><b>Anomalous Forms.</b>&mdash;M&uuml;ller has described a <i>Calotermes</i> under the name of <i>C.
  rugosus</i>, which is interesting on account of the peculiar form of the young larva, and of the
  changes by which it subsequently becomes similar in form to other species of the genus. We
  represent the development of this larva in Fig. 237. We may call attention to the fact that this
  figure illustrates the large size of the paunch, which is so extraordinary in some of the states
  of the Termitidae.</p>

  <p>It will be recollected that the genus <i>Calotermes</i> is destitute of workers. There is
  another genus, <i>Anoplotermes</i>, in which the reverse condition prevails, and the soldier is
  absent; this is the only case yet known in which such a state of affairs exists. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page383"><span class="smaller">{383}</span></span>The species is called <i>A.
  pacificus</i> by Fritz M&uuml;ller; it differs from other Termitidae in possessing a proventriculus
  destitute of triturating ridges. The nests of this species are utilised by a little
  <i>Eutermes</i> (<i>E. inquilinus</i> M&uuml;ller) for its own advantage; whether by first destroying
  the <i>Anoplotermes</i> or whether by merely taking possession of the nests abandoned by their
  owners is not known. It is a most remarkable fact that the <i>Eutermes</i> resembles the
  <i>Anoplotermes</i> so extremely that the two can scarcely be distinguished, though anatomically
  they are quite different. The resemblance is indeed so great that it deceived Von Jhering into
  supposing that the two genera were alternate generations of a single species, one generation
  possessing soldiers, the other being without them. Subsequently, by anatomical investigation, he
  recognised<a id="NtA_299" href="#Nt_299"><sup>[299]</sup></a> the error into which he had
  fallen&mdash;an error that, under such peculiar circumstances, was quite pardonable.</p>

  <p>Hagen has suggested<a id="NtA_300" href="#Nt_300"><sup>[300]</sup></a> that <i>Hodotermes
  japonicus</i> never produces winged forms. Very little, however, is actually known as to this
  species.</p>

  <p><b>Marching and Harvesting Termites.</b>&mdash;Smeathman alluded to a remarkable <i>Termes</i>
  seen by him in Africa, giving it the name of <i>T. viarum</i>. Nothing further is known of this
  Insect, which, according to Smeathman's account, may possibly be the most remarkable of the
  family. <i>T. viarum</i> is said to be larger than <i>T. bellicosus</i>, and was discovered
  issuing in large numbers from a hole in the ground and marching in columns consisting of workers
  directed by soldiers of enormous size, some of whom <span class="pagenum" id="page384"><span
  class="smaller">{384}</span></span>climbed up plants and gave audible signals to the army, which
  immediately responded with a hissing noise and by increasing their pace with the utmost hurry;
  they continued marching by the spot where Smeathman observed them for upwards of an hour. He was
  not able to find their nests, and no specimens have been preserved; both soldiers and workers
  possessed eyes. Marching in this way by daylight is contrary to the nature of ordinary Termites,
  and some doubt has existed as to the correctness of Smeathman's observation, which has in fact
  remained for upwards of a century without confirmation.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Mr. G. D. Haviland has, however, this year discovered in Natal a Termite which shows that there
  are species in Africa of the kind described by Smeathman, the workers and soldiers being possessed
  of facetted eyes. Mr. Haviland states that the workers of this species issue from holes in the
  ground during the heat of the day and cut grass both dead and green. They carry it, in lengths of
  about two inches, to the mouths of the holes, often leaving it there and going at once to fetch
  more. Under acacia bushes they carry acacia leaflets as well as grass. In the middle of the day
  more grass accumulates at the entrance to the holes than can be taken in, but as the heat of the
  day diminishes the workers cease to forage and take in the accumulation. When the grass is all in
  they sometimes close the mouth of the hole with moistened pellets of earth brought in their
  mouths. The soldiers remain in the holes; when disturbed they jerk themselves like soldiers of
  other species to frighten away the intruder; when they bite, their grip is very tenacious. The
  holes are about &#x2153; of an inch in diameter, and there are usually several of them a few yards
  apart; around each <span class="pagenum" id="page385"><span class="smaller">{385}</span></span>of
  them is a patch over which the grass has been cut quite short. Mr. Haviland followed these holes
  by digging for a distance of 20 feet and to a depth of 5&frac12; feet; they remain uniform in size except
  that near the entrance there may be one or two chambers in which the grass is temporarily stored,
  but these do not hold more than would be collected in an hour or two. As the burrow descends it is
  occasionally joined by another, and at the point of junction there is usually a considerable
  widening. Sometimes they run straight for 6 or 7 feet, sometimes they curve abruptly, sometimes
  they are nearly horizontal, but near the mouth may be almost vertical in direction. These Termites
  are very local, but the specimens are numerous when found. Mr. Haviland dug for these Insects at
  two places on the Tugela river, one of them being at Colenso. It is much to be regretted that he
  was unable to reach the nest. We figure a soldier selected from specimens sent by Mr. Haviland to
  the Cambridge University Museum. This Insect is apparently much smaller than Smeathman's <i>T.
  viarum</i>. Other species of Termitidae have been described<a id="NtA_301"
  href="#Nt_301"><sup>[301]</sup></a> as forming underground tunnels in Africa, but none of the
  species have yet been satisfactorily identified.</p>

  <p>It was stated by Smeathman that some species of Termites had chambers in their habitations in
  which grew a kind of fungus used by the Insects for food; Mr. Haviland is able to confirm
  Smeathman in this particular; he having found fungus-chambers in the nests of more than one
  species both in Singapore and South Africa (Fig. 240).</p>

  <p><b>Habitations.</b>&mdash;In nothing do Termites differ more than in the habitations they form.
  Sometimes, as we have mentioned in the case of <i>Calotermes</i>, there is no real structure
  formed; only a few barriers being erected in burrows or natural hollows in wood. In other cases
  very extensive structures are formed, so that the work of the Termites becomes a conspicuous
  feature in the landscape. This is of course only the case in regions that are not much interfered
  with by man; the great dwellings spoken of by Smeathman and others soon disappear from the
  neighbourhood of settlements, but in parts of Africa and in Australia large dwellings are still
  formed by these creatures. In the latter part of the world there exists a very remarkable one,
  formed by an <span class="pagenum" id="page386"><span
  class="smaller">{386}</span></span>undetermined species called by the officers and crew of her
  Majesty's ship <i>Penguin</i> the "compass ant." The outline of one of the structures formed by
  this Termite we represent in Fig. 239. Mr. J. J. Walker, to whom we are indebted for the sketch
  from which this figure is taken, has also favoured us with the following extract from his diary,
  of date 4th August 1890: "The most interesting feature in the scenery (about forty miles inland
  from Port Darwin) was the constant succession of huge mounds raised by the Termites, of which I
  had seen some comparatively small examples in my rambles near Port Darwin; but these exceeded in
  dimensions all I had ever seen. The most frequent as well as the largest kind was usually of a
  reddish or ferruginous colour outside, and generally almost cylindrical in shape with
  obtusely-pointed top, but nearly always more or less weather-worn, with great irregular buttresses
  and deep ruts down the sides; many of them look like ruined towers in miniature. Their usual
  height was from 8 to 10 feet, but many were much higher, and some attained an (estimated)
  elevation of at least 20 feet. Another kind, seen only in one or two places along the line, was of
  a much more singular character; they averaged only 4 to 5 feet high, were built of a dark-gray
  mud, and in shape were like thin flat wedges set upright (see Fig. 239), reminding one of
  tombstones in a churchyard. But the most remarkable feature about these mounds was that they had
  all the same orientation, viz. with the long faces of the wedge pointing nearly north and south.
  Why this is so I am quite at a loss to imagine, and I much regret that I had no opportunity of
  closely examining these most singular structures. A third kind of mound, usually not exceeding 2
  feet in height, was of a simple, acute, conical figure, and generally of a gray colour somewhat
  paler than the last."</p>

  </div>

  <p>The material used for the construction of the dwellings is either earth, wood, or the excrement
  of the Termites. The huge edifices mentioned by Smeathman are composed of earth cemented <span
  class="pagenum" id="page387"><span class="smaller">{387}</span></span>together so as to look like
  stone or brick, and the buildings appear to be almost as strong as if they were actually
  constructed with these materials. In many cases the substance used is comminuted wood that has
  passed one or more times through the alimentary canal of the Insects, and may therefore be called
  excrement. Whether the stone-like material is made from earth that has passed through the
  alimentary canal or from grains gathered for the purpose has not been well ascertained. In any
  case the material is cemented together by means of the secretions of glands. Dudley and Beaumont
  have described the process of construction, in a species observed by them, saying that earth is
  brought and placed in position by the mandibles, and cemented by liquid from the abdomen.<a
  id="NtA_302" href="#Nt_302"><sup>[302]</sup></a> Von Jhering says<a id="NtA_303"
  href="#Nt_303"><sup>[303]</sup></a> that some species form the exterior walls of their dwellings
  of stone-like material, but make use of woody matter for the construction of the interior.
  Smeathman has described the nest of <i>Termes bellicosus</i>. The whole of the very strong
  external wall consists of clay-like material, cemented by the secretions of the Termites to a very
  firm consistence. The royal cell is built of the same material as the framework of the nest;
  whilst the nurseries in which the young are chiefly found are built of woody material, and are
  always covered with a kind of mould&mdash;the mycelium of a fungus&mdash;and plentifully sprinkled
  with small white bodies, which, under the microscope, are found to be filled with a number of
  oblong, spore-like cells.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>These nurseries rest on the clay-like framework of the nest, but are not attached thereto; they
  in no way support it, or one another, indeed they have the appearance of being constantly added to
  on their upper margins and constantly eaten away on their under parts. Fig. 240 represents the
  appearance of the upper boundary of a nursery taken from a nest of <i>Termes angustatus</i>. The
  small white bodies, mentioned above, have disappeared: the mycelium of the fungus, though not

  is still visible on the specimen from which it was drawn, and gives rise to a whitish, glaucous
  appearance.</p>

  <p>In various parts of the world nests formed on trees by Termites are to be seen; these tree
  nests are, it would appear, in some cases only parts of a community, and are connected with the
  main body by galleries. In other cases nests are formed in various positions of advantage; Messrs.
  Hubbard and Hagen have given us an account<a id="NtA_304" href="#Nt_304"><sup>[304]</sup></a> of
  some of these&mdash;probably the work of <i>Eutermes ripperti</i>&mdash;as seen in Jamaica. They
  describe the nests as spherical or conical masses, looking externally as if composed of loamy
  earth; they are placed on trees, fences, or walls; they vary in size from that of a man's fist to
  that of a hogshead; they appear to be composed of finely comminuted wood fastened together by
  saliva. These nests are formed on the same principle as those of the wasps that make nests hanging
  to trees and bushes, as they consist of an external protecting envelope covering a comb-like mass
  in the interior. At the bottom of the nest there is a covered gallery leading to the earth, where
  the main nest appears to be situate; galleries also are constructed so as to lead to the tops of
  trees and other places, in such a manner that the Termite can still keep up its peculiarity of
  working and travelling in tunnels and yet roam over a large area; the activity of these Termites
  continues day and night. In each nest there is a queen, who lays eggs that are removed by the
  worker Termites to the bottom of the nest. The young are fed on a prepared food, consisting
  apparently of comminuted vegetable matter, of which considerable masses are laid in store. Some of
  the nests are rich in containing many pounds' weight of this material, while others are apparently
  quite destitute of it. There is a soldier form and at least two kinds of workers. Some species of

  Insects live together is not stated.</p>

  <p><b>Termite Ravages.</b>&mdash;In countries whose climate is favourable to their constitutions
  certain kinds of Termites become of great importance to our own species. Owing to their taste for
  woody matter and to their habit of working in concealment, it is no uncommon thing for it to be
  discovered that Termites have obtained access to a building and have practically destroyed the
  wooden materials used in its construction; all the interior of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page389"><span class="smaller">{389}</span></span>wood being eaten away and only a thin outer
  shell left intact. A Termite, <i>T. tenuis</i>, was introduced&mdash;in what manner is not
  certainly known<a id="NtA_305" href="#Nt_305"><sup>[305]</sup></a>&mdash;to the Island of St.
  Helena, and committed such extensive ravages there that Jamestown, the capital, was practically
  destroyed and new buildings had to be erected. Other such cases are on record. Destructive species
  can sometimes be destroyed by placing in the nests a portion of arsenicated food. This is eaten by
  some individuals, who perish in consequence; and their dead bodies being consumed by their
  comrades, the colony becomes checked if not exterminated.</p>

  <p>The number of described species of Termitidae does not much exceed 100, but this is certainly
  only a small portion of those existing, the total of which may probably reach 1000 species.</p>

  <p>Termitidae are classed by some naturalists with the Orthoptera, and they have a great deal in
  common with some of the cursorial division of that Order, more particularly Forficulidae and
  Blattidae; but they differ from Orthoptera in the nature and form of the wings. They are also
  classed by some, with a few other forms, as a separate Order of Pseudo-Neuroptera called
  Corrodentia, but this is not a very satisfactory course, as the Termitidae do not agree closely
  with the forms associated with them, while the aggregate so formed is far from being very distinct
  from other forms of Neuroptera. On the whole the best plan appears to be to treat the Termitidae
  as forming a distinct family of the Order Neuroptera, or to make it a distinct Order, as proposed
  by Grassi. Packard now associates Termites in an Order with the biting-lice, and calls it
  Platyptera.</p>

  <p class="sp5"><b>Fossil Termites.</b>&mdash;Termitidae were very abundant in Tertiary times, and
  the genera appear to have been then much the same as at present. In Mesozoic strata the remains of
  true Termitidae apparently exist in the Lias in Europe, but farther back than this the family has
  not been satisfactorily traced. It was formerly supposed that Termitidae existed in the
  Carboniferous strata, but this appears to be very doubtful; and the fossil remains of that epoch,
  which were presumed to be those of Termites, are now referred by Scudder and others to the
  Neuropteroid division of the Order Palaeodictyoptera, an Order which is formed entirely of
  Palaeozoic fossil remains.</p>

  <p>The antennae consist of eleven to twenty-five joints, or even more, about thirteen being the
  usual number; the basal two are thicker than the others, and are destitute of setae or pubescence
  such as the others possess. The maxillae and labium are remarkable. The former possesses a
  peculiar hard pick or elongate rod; this is considered by many naturalists to be the inner lobe,
  but Burgess thinks it more probably an independent organ,<a id="NtA_307"
  href="#Nt_307"><sup>[307]</sup></a> as it has no articulation of any kind with the outer lobe. The
  latter is remarkably thick and fleshy; the palpus is 5-jointed. Other authorities consider the
  pick to be certainly the inner lobe; if it be not, the latter is quite wanting. Hagen agrees with
  Burgess in stating that the pick slides in the outer lobe as in a sheath. The labium has a large
  mentum and a ligula divided anteriorly into two lobes; at each outer angle in front there is a
  globular projection, which is doubtless the labial palpus; reposing on the labium there is a large
  free lingua. The labrum is large, attached to a distinct clypeus, behind which there is a
  remarkable post-clypeus, which is usually prominent as if inflated; to its inner face are attached
  several muscles which converge to be inserted on a plate placed below the anterior part of the
  oesophagus, and called by Burgess the <span class="pagenum" id="page392"><span
  class="smaller">{392}</span></span>oesophageal bone; under or within the lingua there is a pair of
  lingual glands. Judging from Grosse's study of the mouth of Mallophaga, we may conclude that the
  oesophageal bone will prove to be a sclerite of the hypopharynx. The eyes of the winged forms are
  frequently remarkably convex, and there are also three ocelli, triangularly placed on the vertex.
  The head is free and very mobile. The coxae are rather small, exserted, contiguous; the sterna
  small. The abdomen has usually ten segments, though sometimes only nine can be detected.</p>

  <p>The thorax in Psocidae usually looks as if it consisted of only two segments. This is due to
  two opposite conditions: (1) that in the winged forms the prothorax is reduced to a plate
  concealed in the fissure between the head and the mesothorax bearing the first pair of wings; (2)
  that in the wingless forms (Fig. 247), though the prothorax is distinct, the meso- and metathorax
  are fused into one segment.</p>

  <p>The internal anatomy is only very incompletely known. Nitzsch<a id="NtA_308"
  href="#Nt_308"><sup>[308]</sup></a> has, however, described the alimentary canal and the
  reproductive organs of <i>Clothilla pulsatoria</i>. The former is remarkably simple: no
  proventriculus or crop was found; the stomach is very elongate, and consists of a sac-like
  anterior portion and an elongate, tubular posterior part. There are four Malpighian tubes. The
  posterior part of the canal is remarkably short, the small intestine being scarcely as long as the
  rectum. The ovaries (Fig. 244, B) consist of five egg-tubes on each side; connected with the
  oviduct there is a peculiar accessory gland consisting of a sac containing other small sacs each
  <span class="pagenum" id="page393"><span class="smaller">{393}</span></span>with an elongate
  efferent duct; the number of the secondary sacs varies from one to four according to the
  individual. The testis (Fig. 244, A, <i>b</i>) is a simple capsule; connected with the base of the
  ejaculatory duct there is a pair of elongate accessory glands or vesiculae seminales.</p>

  <p>The life-history has never been satisfactorily sketched. The young greatly resemble the old,
  but have no ocelli or wings, and sometimes the tarsi are of two joints, while in the adult they
  have three. The antennae have also in these cases a less number of joints in the young stage. The
  food is animal or vegetable refuse substances; many live on fungoid matter of various kinds,
  mouldy chaff being, it is said, a favourite pabulum; the mould on palings is a source of food to
  many; others live on the rust-fungi of leaves, and many frequent the bark of trees. They are able
  to spin webs, probably by the aid of the lingual glands; the eggs are deposited, in some cases, on
  leaves and covered with a web. Hagen says that a peculiar organ, possibly a gland&mdash;he calls
  it a hose<a id="NtA_309" href="#Nt_309"><sup>[309]</sup></a>&mdash;exists at the base of the
  tarsal claws. In our climate most of the species pass the winter in the egg-state. There may be
  two generations in a year, perhaps more.</p>

  <p>The nomenclature of the wing-veins of Psocidae has given rise to much discussion.<a
  id="NtA_310" href="#Nt_310"><sup>[310]</sup></a> The system shown in the accompanying figure is
  probably the most convenient; the subcostal vein (2) is always obscure, and sometimes can only be
  detected by very minute examination. Some interesting information as to the minute structure and
  mode of formation of the wings and their nervures has been given by Hagen.<a id="NtA_311"

  <p>In the young the wings first appear as buds, or outgrowths of the sides of the meso- and

  wing-rudiments attached to them increase. The wings from their very origin appear to be different
  from those of the Orthoptera, and the changes that take place in the thoracic <span

      unipunctatus</i>. <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, Wings. (After Bertkau.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There are several peculiarities connected with the wings. Frequently they exist, though of no
  use for flight; some Psocidae that have perfectly-formed wings are so reluctant to use them that,
  M&lsquo;Lachlan says, they will allow themselves to be crushed without seeking to escape by
  flight. At certain periods, however, some Psocidae float on the wing in considerable numbers,
  especially in a moist still atmosphere, and then drift about like the winged Aphididae, which are
  frequently found with them. There is evidence that individuals, or generations, of some of the
  winged species occur with only rudimentary wings; although this has been denied by Kolbe, there
  can be no doubt about it. The form figured above (Fig. 246) was described by Bertkau<a
  id="NtA_312" href="#Nt_312"><sup>[312]</sup></a> as a distinct genus, but was afterwards
  recognised by him<a id="NtA_313" href="#Nt_313"><sup>[313]</sup></a> to be a short-winged form of
  <i>Mesopsocus unipunctatus</i>. It is probable that the adult female of this species has the wings
  always micropterous, while the male has these organs of the full size. In other species the
  condition of the rudimentary wings seems to be quite constant. The facts concerning the wings of
  Psocidae are so peculiar that Kolbe came to the conclusion that the organs exist not because they
  are of use for flight, so much as because it is the nature of an Insect to develop wings.<a
  id="NtA_314" href="#Nt_314"><sup>[314]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Some of the species of Psocidae have never any trace of wings. These apterous forms are mostly
  included in the division Atropinae, and are usually very minute; it has been again and again
  erroneously stated that they are the young state of winged forms. Hagen kept a large colony of
  <i>Atropos divinatoria</i> for some years in confinement, so that he saw numerous generations as
  well as many specimens. He found the apterous condition quite constant.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page395"><span class="smaller">{395}</span></span></div>

  <p>The association of ocelli with wings is nearly constant in Psocidae. The genus
  <i>Clothilla</i>&mdash;allied to <i>Atropos</i>&mdash;possesses very rudimentary wings but no
  ocelli. Hagen, however, found<a id="NtA_315" href="#Nt_315"><sup>[315]</sup></a> that in a certain
  locality no less than 12 per cent of the individuals of this species were provided with
  ocelli,&mdash;a most extraordinary variation.</p>

  <p>In some of these apterous forms there is found on each side of the prothorax a tubercular
  prominence which, according to Hagen, can be considered only as the rudiment of a wing that never
  develops. Though no existing Insect is known to possess rudimentary wings on the prothorax, we
  have previously mentioned (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page344">344</a></span>) that in the
  Carboniferous epoch appendages of the nature alluded to were not very rare.</p>

  <p>A genus of living forms&mdash;<i>Hyperetes</i>&mdash;in which the three thoracic segments are
  well developed, but in which there are no alar appendages or rudiments, is considered by Hagen to
  be more primitive than the Psocidae found in amber to which we shall subsequently allude.</p>

  <p>The number of described species of Psocidae does not reach two hundred; we have, however,
  thirty species or more in Britain.<a id="NtA_316" href="#Nt_316"><sup>[316]</sup></a> Nietner
  observed about the same number in the immediate vicinity of his house in Ceylon. The isolated and
  remote Hawaiian group of islands is remarkably rich in Psocidae. Two thousand is a moderate
  estimate of the number of existing species. The largest forms yet discovered belong to the
  Brazilian genus <i>Thyrsophorus</i>; they attain, however, a breadth of only about one inch with
  the wings fully expanded. The Cuban genus <i>Embidopsocus</i> is said to be of great interest from
  its approximation to Embiidae. It is at present very inadequately known.</p>

  <p>One (or more) very minute Insects of this family&mdash;<i>Clothilla pulsatoria</i> according to
  Hagen, <i>Atropos<a id="NtA_317" href="#Nt_317"><sup>[317]</sup></a> divinatoria</i> according to
  some other authors&mdash;is widely known under the name of the death-watch, owing to its being
  believed to make a peculiar <span class="pagenum" id="page396"><span
  class="smaller">{396}</span></span>ticking noise, supposed to be prophetic of the decease of some
  individual&mdash;a human being we fancy, not a death-watch. It is difficult to believe that so
  minute and soft an Insect can produce a sound audible to human ears, and many entomologists are of
  opinion that the sound in question is really produced by a beetle&mdash;of the genus
  <i>Anobium</i>&mdash;which lives in wood, and that as the beetle may be concealed in a hole, while
  the <i>Clothilla</i> is seen running about, the sound is naturally, though erroneously, attributed
  to the latter. But the rapping of the <i>Anobium</i> is well known, is produced while the Insect
  is at large, and is said to be a different noise from that of the Psocid; evidence too has been
  given as to the production of the sound in a workbox when the Psocid was certainly present, and
  the most careful search failed to reveal any beetle.</p>

  <p>The Rev. W. Derham, who two hundred years ago was Rector of Upminster, in Essex, and was well
  known as a distinguished writer and philosopher, gave an account of the ticking of death-watches
  to the Royal Society.<a id="NtA_318" href="#Nt_318"><sup>[318]</sup></a> This gentleman was a most
  accurate and minute observer; he was well acquainted with the ticking of the greater
  death-watch&mdash;<i>Anobium</i>&mdash;which he describes very accurately, as well as the acts
  accompanying it, the details he mentions being exactly such as occur at the present time. He not
  only heard the ticking of the Psocid or lesser death-watch, but repeatedly witnessed it. He says:
  "I am now so used to, and skilful in the matter as to be able to see, and show them, beating
  almost when I please, by having a paper with some of them in it conveniently placed and imitating
  their pulsation, which they will readily answer." He also states that he could only hear them
  beating when it was done on paper, and that this death-watch will tick for some hours together
  without intermission, with intervals between each beat, so that it much resembles the ticking of a
  watch. The act of ticking was <span class="pagenum" id="page397"><span
  class="smaller">{397}</span></span>accompanied by rapping the front of the head on the paper, but
  Mr. Derham could not be sure that the sound was produced in that manner, because each stroke was
  also accompanied by a peculiar shudder, or recoil. After a prolonged ticking he observed that
  another individual of the other sex made its appearance. The species figured by Mr. Derham more
  resembles a <i>Hyperetes</i> than it does either of our two known book-lice, <i>Atropos</i> and
  <i>Clothilla</i>.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Numerous species of Psocidae are preserved in amber; Hagen<a id="NtA_319"
  href="#Nt_319"><sup>[319]</sup></a> has made a careful study, based on a considerable number of
  specimens, of about thirteen such species. They belong to no less than nine genera and five
  sub-families. <i>Sphaeropsocus</i> is the most remarkable; this Insect has a well-developed
  prothorax, as is the case in the wingless Psocids, and a pair of large wings or tegmina meeting by
  a straight suture along the back, as is usual in beetles, though quite unknown in existing
  Psocidae. Another species, <i>Amphientomum paradoxum</i>, has the body and appendages covered with
  scales like a butterfly or moth; other species, found in gum-copal or still living, have scales on
  various parts of the body, but not to so great an extent as this amber species. The genus
  <i>Amphientomum</i> is still represented in Ceylon and elsewhere by living forms; Packard has
  figured some of the scales;<a id="NtA_320" href="#Nt_320"><sup>[320]</sup></a> they appear to be
  extremely similar to those of Lepidoptera or Thysanura. The facts connected with this fauna of
  amber Psocidae would seem to show that the family was formerly more extensive and important than
  it is at present; we should therefore expect to find numerous fossil forms in strata of date <span
  class="pagenum" id="page398"><span class="smaller">{398}</span></span>anterior to that of the

  </div>

  <p>The Perlidae form a small family of Insects unattractive in their general appearance. The
  life-history of each individual consists of two abruptly contrasted portions; the earlier stage
  being entirely aquatic, the later aerial. Hence the Perlidae come into the amphibious division of
  Neuroptera. The definition we have given above would, except as regards the texture of the front
  wings and the aquatic habits of the larvae, apply to many Insects of the Order Orthoptera. The
  Phryganeidae, another <span class="pagenum" id="page399"><span
  class="smaller">{399}</span></span>family of Neuroptera, have aquatic larvae and wings somewhat
  similar in form to those of the Perlidae, but the members of the two families cannot be
  confounded, as the Phryganeidae have hairy front wings and large and contiguous coxae.</p>

  <p>The antennae of the Perlidae are long, very flexible, and composed of a very large number of
  joints. The parts of the mouth vary a good deal. The mandibles and maxillae are usually rather
  small, and all the parts of the mouth are of feeble consistence or even membranous; the maxillary
  palpi are, however, well developed and exserted from the mouth, five-jointed. The labium is short
  and but little conspicuous. The mandibles in some forms are almost membranous, but in other genera
  they are firmer and are toothed. The labium is composed of a very large mentum, beyond which is a
  large piece, usually undivided, bearing the four terminal lobes; the three-jointed palpus is
  seated on the side of the large middle sclerite, which is no doubt of composite nature.
  Considerable variety as to the lower lip prevails. The head is broad and flat; there is an
  indistinctly-indicated clypeus, three&mdash;more rarely two&mdash;ocelli, and on each side an eye
  neither very large nor perfect. The prothorax is free, and has a flat, margined notum. The meso-
  and the meta-thorax are large, equal segments. The pro-, meso-, and meta-sternum are large pieces;
  between the first and second, and between the second and third there is an intervening membrane.
  The metasternum is much prolonged backwards, and has on each side a peculiar slit; similar
  orifices exist on the other sterna (Fig. 254, <i>o</i>). Newport, who has examined them in
  <i>Pteronarcys</i>, says that they are blind invaginations of the integument; he calls them the
  sternal or furcal orifices.<a id="NtA_321" href="#Nt_321"><sup>[321]</sup></a> According to this
  naturalist these very peculiar openings pass into the body "as strong bone-like tubes, diverging
  from the axis to the periphery of the body in the immediate vicinity of some of the principal
  tracheae, but that they do not in any way communicate with them, as they terminate abruptly as
  caecal structures." He thinks them analogous with the endo-skeleton of other Insects; a view which
  cannot be considered sufficiently established. Laboulb&egrave;ne states<a id="NtA_322"
  href="#Nt_322"><sup>[322]</sup></a> that when <i>Perla parisina</i> is seized and placed on its
  back, it does not move, but emits a liquid at the base of the articulation of the legs. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page400"><span class="smaller">{400}</span></span>This suggests that it may
  come from these sternal orifices.  The abdomen consists of ten dorsal plates, the first being
  short, and of nine ventral; the dorsal plates are much more ample transversely than the ventral.
  Frequently the hind body is terminated by two long, many-jointed cerci, looking like antennae. The
  coxae are small, not prominent, and are directed outwards. The legs are slender, the tibiae often
  grooved. The tarsi are three-jointed, terminating in two claws and a more or less distinct pad. In
  the genus <i>Isopteryx</i> an auditory organ has been described as existing in the legs, in a
  position similar to that of the analogous structures in Termitidae and Blattidae. The wings when
  closed repose flat on the back, and fold and overlap so that only one is seen (Fig. 251); in this
  state the costal portion of each front wing is turned downwards, so as to protect to some extent,
  the sides of the body.</p>

  <p>The early stages are known, but have not been described minutely, and there appears to be very
  little information as to the youngest life. All the species are, when immature, aquatic in their
  habits; the larvae greatly resemble the perfect Insects in form, though differing in not
  possessing wings and in the ocelli being merely opaque spaces. They have rather large compound
  eyes; the future wings are represented by lobe-like prolongations&mdash;varying in length
  according to age&mdash;of the meso- and meta-notum. In the Nemourae the cerci are absent in the
  imago though present in the young. The larvae of Perlidae are carnivorous <span class="pagenum"
  id="page401"><span class="smaller">{401}</span></span>and are able to swim well, the legs being
  provided with abundant swimming hairs; they, however, as a rule, prefer to walk at the bottom of
  the pool, or on rocks or boulders in the water they live in.</p>

  <p>One of the most peculiar features of the Perlidae is their respiratory system. Unfortunately
  the greatest differences of opinion have prevailed on various matters in connexion with this
  subject, and there are several points about which it is not possible at present to express a
  decided opinion.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The larvae have no stigmata; it appears to be generally agreed that there is in them no means
  of admitting air to the tracheal system by means of orifices. Some breathe entirely through the
  integument, the process being aided by the accumulation of tracheae at the spots where the
  breathing orifices should be, and where the integument is more delicate. Others, however, possess
  gills in the form of protruded bunches of filaments, connected with tracheae in the manner shown
  in Fig. 253. These filamentous branchiae occur in numerous species of the family, and are situate
  on various parts of the body, but many species are destitute of them in genera, other members of
  which possess the filaments. In some Nemourae instead of bunches of filaments there are tubular
  projections on the prothoracic segment; and in <i>Dictyopteryx signata</i> similar structures
  occur even in the cephalic region, Hagen stating<a id="NtA_323"
  href="#Nt_323"><sup>[323]</sup></a> that there exists a pair on the submentum and another on the
  membrane between the head and the thorax. In the imago state, stigmata are present in the normal
  fashion, there being two thoracic and six abdominal pairs. In several species the filaments
  persist in the imago, so that in these cases we meet with the curious condition of the coexistence
  of branchiae with a well-developed and functionally active system of spiracles; this is the more
  curious because the creatures usually have then nothing to do with the water, it having been
  ascertained that in these cases the species live out of the water as other terrestrial and aerial
  Insects do. These instances of persistence <span class="pagenum" id="page402"><span
  class="smaller">{402}</span></span>of branchiae during the aerial life have been the source of
  some perplexity; the condition was shown to exist in <i>Pteronarcys</i> by Newport, and has since
  been demonstrated in various other forms. Newport believed that the imago of <i>Pteronarcys</i>
  breathes by means of the gills, although it lives out of the water and possesses spiracles; and he
  informs us that Mr. Barnston observed the Insect when on the wing "constantly dipping on the
  surface of the water." Hence Newport concluded that <i>Pteronarcys</i> in the winged state is "an
  amphibious animal." That a winged Insect should live in the air and yet breathe by means of gills
  would be truly extraordinary, and there can be little doubt that Newport's idea was erroneous.
  Hagen<a id="NtA_324" href="#Nt_324"><sup>[324]</sup></a> was able to examine living imagos of the
  species in question. He found that they avoided the water, and though he placed some individuals
  therein, yet they did not use the gills. He also informs us that the branchiae have, during life,
  a shrivelled appearance, indicating that they are not functionally active, but are merely useless
  organs carried over to the imago from the previous instar, in which they were truly the means of
  obtaining air. Hagen also ascertained that the spiracles of the imago are in a normal state, being
  adapted for breathing, even as far back as the seventh abdominal segment.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Great difference of opinion has prevailed as to the relations of the branchiae to the stigmata,
  it having been contended that the falling off of some of the branchiae left the stigmatic
  orifices. The facts appear to be only consistent with the conclusion that the two are totally
  independent organs. This subject has been investigated by Palm&eacute;n,<a id="NtA_325"
  href="#Nt_325"><sup>[325]</sup></a> who finds that in Perlidae&mdash;contrary to what occurs in
  may-flies&mdash;the species are either entirely destitute of gills, or these organs are persistent
  throughout life. It is not to be inferred from this that the gills in the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page403"><span class="smaller">{403}</span></span>perennibranchiate Perlidae are as
  conspicuous as they are in the exceptional <i>Pteronarcys</i>: for it appears that at the final
  moult the gills usually become very much contracted and concealed by the new integument; in some
  cases they merely appear as slight prominences in the neighbourhood of the stigmata.</p>

  <p>Pictet, Dufour, Newport, and Imhof<a id="NtA_326" href="#Nt_326"><sup>[326]</sup></a> have
  studied the internal anatomy. The alimentary canal is remarkable for the enormous oesophagus;
  there is no distinction between this and the crop. A proventriculus is quite absent, and there are
  no chitinous folds in the position it usually occupies. The true stomach is small, and only
  commences in the fourth abdominal segment. It has a prolonged lobe on each side in front, and in
  addition to this eight sacs; thus there are formed ten diverticula, fastened to the posterior part
  of the oesophagus by ligaments. The terminal portion of the stomach is small, and apparently only
  distinguished from the short intestine by the point of insertion of the Malpighian tubes; these
  vary in number from about twenty to sixty. There are two pairs of large salivary glands. In
  <i>Pteronarcys</i> the caecal diverticula of the stomach are wanting. In some Perlidae the
  terminal parts of the gut are more complex than in <i>Perla maxima</i>; Newport figures both an
  ilium and colon very strongly differentiated, and states that these parts differ much in
  <i>Perla</i> and <i>Pteronarcys</i>. According to him the stomach is embraced by a network of
  tracheae, and Imhof tells us that he found the stomach to contain only air.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

  </div>

  <p>The brain is small, but, according to Imhof, consists of four amalgamated divisions; the
  infra-oesophageal ganglion is small, <span class="pagenum" id="page404"><span
  class="smaller">{404}</span></span>and placed very near the brain.  There are three thoracic and
  six abdominal ganglia on the ventral chain. The nerves to the wings are connected with the
  longitudinal commissures of the ventral chain by peculiar, obliquely-placed, short commissures.
  The reproductive glands are peculiar, inasmuch as in each sex the pair of principal glands is
  connected together in the middle. The testes thus form an arch consisting of a large number of
  sub-spherical or pear-shaped follicles; the vasa deferentia are short in <i>Perla maxima</i>, and
  there are no vesiculae seminales; the ejaculatory duct is divided into three parts by
  constrictions. In <i>Pteronarcys</i> and in <i>Perla bicaudata</i>, according to Newport and
  Dufour, the vasa deferentia are very long and tortuous, and there are elongate vesiculae
  seminales. The arrangement of the extremely numerous egg-tubes is analogous to that of the
  follicles of the testes, so that, as Dufour says, there is but a single ovary; connected with the
  short, unpaired portion of the oviduct, there is a large receptaculum seminis, and near the
  terminal orifice of the duct there is in <i>P. maxima</i> an eight-lobed accessory gland.</p>

  <p>The eggs are produced by Perlidae in enormous numbers: they are rather small, but peculiar in
  form, and possess at one extremity a micropyle apparatus, covered by a glassy substance through
  which Imhof could find no orifice. On the other hand, the chorion on another part of the egg is
  perforated by several canals.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page405"><span class="smaller">{405}</span></span></div>

  <p>The Perlidae being of aquatic habits in their early stages, and, notwithstanding their ample
  wings, very poor adepts in the art of flying, are rarely found at any considerable distance from
  their native element. They are specially fond of running water, and delight in the neighbourhood
  of waterfalls, or other spots where the current is broken by obstacles so that a foaming water
  results. It is probable that the larvae which breathe by means of gills find an advantage in
  living in strongly-aerated water. Mountain streams and torrents are therefore specially affected
  by them; but Pictet informs us that they do not like the waters descending from glaciers. The food
  of the larvae is believed to be chiefly young may-flies, or other small, soft creatures, and it
  may possibly be owing to the absence of these that the Perlidae do not affect the glacier streams.
  Although Perlidae are remarkable for their capacity for enduring cold, it is possible that they
  may require warmth of the water at some period of their development, and this the glacier-streams
  cannot offer to them. They are among the earliest Insects to appear in the spring in Europe. Mr.
  Barnston says that on the Albany river in Canada the nymph of <i>Capnia vernalis</i> comes up
  frequently in the cracks of the ice and casts its skin there; "it frequently comes up when the
  thermometer stands at freezing." Of <i>Nemoura glacialis</i>, which inhabits similar localities,
  he says that "it appears in the spring (end of March or beginning of April) when the ice becomes
  honeycombed, and even before then, at the same time as <i>Capnia vernalis</i>. It pairs in the
  crevices of decaying ice. The male has long antennae, and his wings are generally rumpled as if
  glued together." Newport entertained the idea that those Perlidae that live at low temperatures
  are of lower organisation than the other forms of the family.</p>

  <p>It is a remarkable fact that several Perlidae frequently have&mdash;like <i>Nemoura
  glacialis</i>&mdash;the wings of the male much reduced in size; this being the contrary of the
  rule that usually prevails among Insects to the effect that, when there is a difference in the
  powers of flight, or even in the size of the wings, it is the male that is superior. Mr. J. J.
  Lister met with a very interesting Perlid at Loch Tanna in Arran at the beginning of April 1892.
  In this Insect, which is, according to Mr. M&lsquo;Lachlan, a form of <i>Isogenus nubecula</i>,
  the wings of the female (Fig. 258, B) are reduced to a size much less than those of ordinary <span
  class="pagenum" id="page406"><span class="smaller">{406}</span></span>Perlidae, while those of the
  male (Fig. 258, A) are mere useless rudiments. Morton has pointed out that in Scotland more than
  one species of <i>Taeniopteryx</i> occasionally produces micropterous males, and he associates
  this phenomenon with the early time of their appearance "almost in winter."<a id="NtA_327"
  href="#Nt_327"><sup>[327]</sup></a> In <i>Nemoura trifasciata</i> this reduction of the wings
  takes another but equally curious form; the hind wings of the male being long enough to cover the
  body, while the anterior pair are reduced to mere rudiments.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The phenomena of micropterism in Perlidae are well worthy of more detailed investigation. Mr.
  Morton informs the writer that the male of <i>Perla maxima</i> (Fig. 251) in North Britain has the
  wings so short that they cannot be of any use as organs of flight. In Central Europe the wings are
  ample, as shown in our figure. In <i>Perla cephalotes</i> the male is short-winged in both Britain
  and Central Europe; of the male of <i>Dictyopteryx microcephala</i> only the micropterous form is
  known to exist. In <i>Isogenus nubecula</i> (Fig. 258) it appears that the wings of the female are
  always more ample than those of the male of the same locality, and that local micropterism affects
  the two sexes unequally. Within the Arctic circle this Insect is usually of the Scotch form,
  though the male there occasionally has more ample wings.</p>

  <p>It has been observed that in some Perlidae the eggs, after they have been extruded, are carried
  about by the female; for what reason is not at all known. They are said to be enclosed in a
  membranous capsule at the apex of the abdomen. The number of eggs deposited is sometimes very
  large, amounting to five or six thousand, and they are often of very minute size.</p>

  <p>About twenty-four species of Perlidae occur in Britain.<a id="NtA_328"
  href="#Nt_328"><sup>[328]</sup></a> The <span class="pagenum" id="page407"><span
  class="smaller">{407}</span></span>species from all parts of the world existing in collections
  probably scarcely exceed two hundred. The insignificance of this number is no doubt chiefly due to
  the fact that these unattractive Insects are rarely captured by collectors, and are so fragile
  that unless good care is taken of them, specimens soon go to destruction after being dried.
  Perlidae are known to occur in most parts of the world, so that the number of species really
  existing may reach two or three thousand. They are known to anglers as stone-flies and creepers
  and are a favourite bait for trout.</p>

  <p>The family in its character comes near to the Orthoptera, especially to the more simple forms
  of Phasmidae, but the two groups differ in the texture of the front wings and in the structure of
  the mouth-parts, as well as in the different proportions of the mesothorax and metathorax.
  According to Pictet, in the Australian genus <i>Eusthenia</i> the trophi (Fig. 259) approach
  nearer to those of the Orthoptera, so that it appears possible that a more intimate connexion will
  be found to exist as more forms are discovered. Of the groups we include in Neuroptera, Perlidae
  are in structure most allied to Sialidae, but the development in the two groups exhibits very
  important distinctions. Brauer treats the Perlidae as forming a distinct Order called Plecoptera,
  a name applied to the family by Burmeister many years ago.</p>

  <p>Several species of Perlidae, considered to belong to existing genera, have been found in amber.
  A fossil from the Eocene deposits in the Isle of Wight and another from the Miocene of Continental
  Europe are referred to the family. Brauer has recently described<a id="NtA_329"
  href="#Nt_329"><sup>[329]</sup></a> some fossils from the Jurassic formation in East Siberia as
  forming three genera, now extinct, of Perlidae.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Brongniart informs us<a id="NtA_330" href="#Nt_330"><sup>[330]</sup></a> that
  several fossils have been found <span class="pagenum" id="page408"><span
  class="smaller">{408}</span></span>in the Carboniferous strata of Commentry that justify us in
  asserting that allies of Perlidae then existed. He considers these Carboniferous Insects to have
  belonged to a separate family, Protoperlides. The fragments are, however, so small that we must
  await further information before forming a definite opinion as to these Protoperlides.</p>

  <p>The dragon-flies form a very natural and distinct group of Insects. All the species are
  recognised with ease as belonging to the family. They are invariably provided with wings in the
  perfect state, and many of them are amongst the most active of Insects. Their anatomy is, in
  several respects, very remarkable.</p>

  <p>The head is large and is concave behind; it is attached to the thorax in such a way that it
  rotates on two cervical sclerites that project forwards, and in some cases almost meet in a point
  in front; hence it possesses extreme mobility, the power of rotation being very great.</p>

  <p>The eyes are always large; in some cases they are even enormous, and occupy the larger part of
  the area of the head: the upper facets of the eye are in many cases larger than the lower, and in
  a few forms the line of division is sharply marked transversely. There are three ocelli, which,
  when the size of the compound eyes is not too great, are placed in the usual <span class="pagenum"
  id="page410"><span class="smaller">{410}</span></span>manner as a triangle on the vertex; but in
  the forms where the compound eyes are very large the portion of the head between is, as it were,
  puffed out so as to form a projection just in front of where the eyes meet, and one ocellus is
  then placed on each side of this projection, an antenna being inserted quite close to it; the
  third ocellus is placed in front of the projection we have mentioned, by which it is often much
  concealed; this anterior ocellus is in some cases of unusually large size, and oval or transverse
  in form.</p>

  <p>The parts of the mouth are very peculiar, especially the lower lip: we will briefly allude to
  its characters in the highly modified forms, premising that in the smaller and less active species
  it is less remarkable. The Libellulidae are carnivorous, their prey being living Insects which are
  captured by the dragon-fly on the wing; it is believed that the mouth is largely instrumental in
  the capture, though the flight of these Insects is so excessively rapid that it is difficult, if
  not impossible, to verify the action of the mouthpieces by actual observation.</p>

  <p>For the purpose of securing the prey a mouth that can change its capacity to a considerable
  extent and with rapidity is a desideratum, and these qualities are present in the mouths of those
  Libellulidae that capture their prey while hawking. The upper lip is very mobile, is pendent, and
  closes the mouth above, while the lower lip entirely closes the under part by means of two mobile
  plates; these in some forms (<i>Libellula</i>) meet together in the mesial line, while in others a
  third plate separates them in the middle (Fig. 261, B, <i>li</i>). These plates are, according to
  Gerstaecker's view,<a id="NtA_331" href="#Nt_331"><sup>[331]</sup></a> portions of the much
  changed labial palpi, the part that separates them in <i>Aeschna</i> being the inner lobes of the
  labial maxillae; in <i>Libellula</i>, where the dilated and valve-like joints of the palpi meet in
  the middle line, the labial lobes remain small and are overlapped by the dilated portions of the
  palpi. The maxillae proper (Fig. 261, A) are less peculiar, their chief character being that the
  inner and outer lobes are not separated, and that the palpus is of only one joint. Some
  entomologists take, however, another view of this structure, looking on the palp-like outer part
  (<i>p</i> of our figure) as the true outer lobe of the maxillae, the palpus proper being in that
  case considered to be entirely absent. The mandibles are very powerful, and armed with largely
  developed teeth. In the interior of the mouth there is a large, free, semi-membranous lingua, the
  posterior part of its delicate inferior lamina being connected with the mentum; the upper lamina
  of the lingua is stronger and is pilose. The antennae of the dragon-flies are always small, and
  consist of two stouter joints at the <span class="pagenum" id="page412"><span
  class="smaller">{412}</span></span>base, and a terminal part which is very slender and pointed,
  and formed of four or five joints.</p>

  <p>The prothorax is always small; the pronotum is distinct, though in some forms it is quite
  concealed in the concavity of the back of the head; the sternum is small; the anatomy of the
  pleura and basal pieces of the legs is obscure.</p>

  <p>The meso- and meta-thorax are very intimately combined, and their relations are such that the
  former is placed much above the latter. This peculiarity is carried to its greatest extent in some
  of the Agrioninae (Fig. 262, A), where not only are the wings placed at a considerable distance
  behind the three pairs of legs, but also the front pair of wings is placed almost directly above
  the hind pair. In the Anisopterides these peculiarities are much less marked (Fig. 262, B),
  nevertheless even in them the three pairs of legs are placed quite in front of the wings. This
  peculiar structure of the wing-bearing segments is accompanied by an unusual development of the
  pleura, which, indeed, actually form the larger part, if not nearly the whole, of the front region
  of the dorsal aspect of these two segments. We shall not enter into more minute particulars as to
  the structure of the thorax, for difference of opinion prevails as to the interpretation of the
  parts.<a id="NtA_332" href="#Nt_332"><sup>[332]</sup></a> The abdomen is remarkable for its
  elongation; it is never broad, and in some genera&mdash;<i>Mecistogaster</i>, <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;it
  attains a length and slenderness which are not <span class="pagenum" id="page413"><span
  class="smaller">{413}</span></span>reached by any other Insects. It consists of ten segments and a
  pair of terminal calliper-like or flap-like processes of very various sizes and forms.</p>

  <p>The wings of the dragon-flies are usually transparent and provided with a multitude of small
  meshes. The hind wings are about as large as the front pair, or even a little larger; the main
  nervures have a sub-parallel course, and are placed in greater part on the anterior region of each
  wing. The relations of the more constant nervures and the cells of which they are parts form a
  complex subject, and are amongst the most important of the characters used in classifying these
  Insects. The wings are always elongate in comparison to their breadth and have no folds; they are
  held partially extended, or are placed so as to project backwards, or backwards and outwards. They
  exhibit another peculiarity, inasmuch as the front or costal margin is slightly uneven before or
  near the middle, giving rise to an appearance such as might result from the breaking and
  subsequent mending of the marginal rib at the spot in question, which is called the nodus. In some
  forms a peculiar character exists in the shape of a small opaque space called the membranule,
  lying close to the body of the Insect in the anal area of the wing, as shown in Fig. 260.</p>

  <p>The legs are slender and are chiefly remarkable for the beautiful series of hair-like spines
  with which they are armed, and which in some forms (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Platycnemis</i>, Fig. 264) are
  of considerable length. We believe that the legs are of great importance in capturing the prey,
  they being held somewhat in the position shown in Fig. 262, C. The tarsi are three-jointed. In the
  male of <i>Libellago caligata</i> the legs exhibit a remarkable condition, the tibiae being
  dilated, and on the upper side of a vivid red colour, while below they are white. This coloration
  and form are each unusual in the family. The male of <i>Platycnemis pennipes</i>, a British
  species (Fig. 264), shows a similar dilatation of the tibiae, but to a less extent and without any
  great difference in the colour of the two faces of the dilatation. This dilatation reaches its
  maximum in <i>Psilocnemis dilatipes</i> M&lsquo;Lach. The position of the legs in relation to the
  other parts of the body is peculiar to the dragon-flies; the legs seem to be unfit for walking,
  the Insects never using them for that purpose.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page414"><span class="smaller">{414}</span></span></div>

  <p>Several peculiarities in the internal anatomy deserve notice. The alimentary canal in
  <i>Libellula</i> is about as long as the body, the oesophagus and chylific stomach being elongate,
  while the intestine is short and divided into only two parts; there is no definite proventriculus.
  The Malpighian tubules are shorter than usual; they are about forty in number. The male has no
  vesiculae seminales; the vasa deferentia are elongate, and the ejaculatory duct is very short,
  being in fact merely a common sinus formed by the terminations of the vasa deferentia. The opening
  of this duct is situated on the penultimate ventral plate; the organs of intromission are,
  however, placed much anterior to this, on the under side of the second segment. The mode in which
  the fertilising fluid is transferred from the ninth to the second segment is not well understood,
  but it is known that the abdomen is flexed by the Insect so as to bring the ninth ventral plate
  into contact with the second. The three thoracic ganglia of the nervous chain are all contiguous,
  though not completely amalgamated; the abdominal ganglia are seven in number, and are all
  separated, the terminal one being larger than the others. Dufour, after repeated dissections, was
  unable to find any salivary glands, but Olga Poletajewa<a id="NtA_333"
  href="#Nt_333"><sup>[333]</sup></a> states that they exist.</p>

  <p>The Odonata must be ranked among the most highly-organised Insects so far as external structure
  and powers of locomotion are concerned; the peculiar modifications of the thoracic segments and
  the relative positions of the wings and legs mark a great departure from the normal type of Insect
  structure. Their prey consists of living Insects, which they capture on the wing by their own
  superior powers of flight. They destroy a great many Insects, their appetite for food being, as in
  the cases of the Mantidae and of the tiger-beetles, apparently almost insatiable. They are
  admirably constructed for the purposes of their predatory lives; they fly with great swiftness and
  change the direction of their flight with admirable facility. They are, however, dependent on
  sunshine, and conceal themselves in dull and cloudy weather. The larger Insects of the family
  belong to the division Anisopterides (Fig. 260, <i>Anax formosus</i>) and some of these may, in
  our own country, usually be seen, in the bright sunshine of the summer and autumn, engaged in
  hawking in their favourite haunts. Places where other Insects <span class="pagenum"
  id="page415"><span class="smaller">{415}</span></span>abound are naturally those most frequented;
  the glades of woods, country lanes and hedge-sides, the borders of streams and the margins of
  sheets of water are the places they most affect. They inspire the rustics with some feeling of
  fear, and hence have received the name of "horse-stingers," and in North America are called
  "devil's darning-needles." The aversion to dragon-flies may perhaps be due to their appearance,
  which is certainly, in the case of some of our species of <i>Aeschna</i>, <i>Cordulegaster</i>,
  and <i>Gomphus</i>, very remarkable, consisting of a dark ground-colour with bars and spots of
  vivid green or yellow, giving, it must be admitted, a peculiar, even savage appearance to the
  Insects. Whatever the reason may be, they are, it is certain, held in much fear, and it is
  difficult to induce a country lad to touch one even when it is captured and held by another
  person. The idea of dragon-flies being dangerous to anything but their Insect victims is, however,
  entirely erroneous; they may be captured and handled without their inflicting any injury. It is
  probable that the life of the imago may endure for several weeks if not months. It is known that
  <i>Sympycna fusca</i>&mdash;a common European though not British dragon-fly&mdash;hibernates in
  the imago state.</p>

  <p>In the case of the large dragon-flies we have mentioned, each individual appears to have a
  domain, as it were, of its own. Westwood tells us that he has seen what he believed to be the same
  individual hawking daily for several weeks together over a small pond. The writer observed a
  specimen of <i>Cordulegaster annulatus</i> to frequent a particular bush, to which it
  returned&mdash;frequently to the same leaf&mdash;after an excursion in search of food. The way in
  which these Insects actually seize their prey has not yet been made clear; it is certain that they
  capture flying Insects, and it seems most probable, as we have already said, that this is done by
  means of the legs. These, as we have said, are inserted so as to be very near to the mouth; they
  are directed forwards, and are held bent at right angles so as to form a sort of net, and are
  armed with a beautiful system of fine spines; it is probable that if the dragon-fly pursue an
  Insect on the wing and strike it with the trap, formed by its six legs (Fig. 262, C), then these
  immediately come together under the mouth, so that the victim, directly it is captured by the
  leg-trap of its pursuer, finds itself in the jaws of its destroyer. It is perhaps impossible to
  <span class="pagenum" id="page416"><span class="smaller">{416}</span></span>verify this by actual
  observation, as the act of capture and transfer is so very brief and is performed in the midst of
  a rapid dash of flight, but it seems more probable that the prey is first struck by the legs than
  that the mouth is the primary instrument of capture. The excessive mobility of the head permits
  the victim to be instantly secured by the mouth, and the captured fly is turned about by this and
  the front pair of legs, and is nipped rapidly so that the wings and drier parts fall off; the more
  juicy parts of the prey are speedily squeezed into a little ball, which is then swallowed, or
  perhaps we should rather say that the mouth closes on it, and submits it to further pressure for
  the extraction of the juices. We have already noted that many of these large and active
  dragon-flies, particularly in the Libellulinae and Aeschninae, have their eyes distinctly divided
  into two parts, the facets in the lower part of the eye being different from those of the upper
  part. Exner considers<a id="NtA_334" href="#Nt_334"><sup>[334]</sup></a> that the upper division
  is for the perception of movement, the lower for the perception of the form of resting objects.
  Plateau thinks<a id="NtA_335" href="#Nt_335"><sup>[335]</sup></a> that the dragon-flies perceive
  only movement, not form.</p>

  <p>The splendid acts of flight of the Anisopterid Odonata are accomplished by the aid of a complex
  arrangement of chitinous pieces at the bases of the wings (Fig. 263). In Insects with considerable
  powers of flight the hind wings are usually subordinate in functional importance to the anterior,
  to which they are attached by a series of hooks, or some other simple mechanism, on the wings.
  <span class="pagenum" id="page417"><span class="smaller">{417}</span></span>In the Odonata the two
  wings of each pair are quite free, but they are perhaps brought into correlative action by means
  of a lever of unusual length existing amongst the chitinous pieces in the body wall at the base of
  the wings (Fig. 263, <i>b</i>). The wing muscles are large; according to von Lendenfeld<a
  id="NtA_336" href="#Nt_336"><sup>[336]</sup></a> there are three elevator, five depressor, and one
  adductor muscles to each wing: he describes the wing movements as the results of the correlative
  action of numerous muscles and ligaments, and of a great number of chitinous pieces connected in a
  jointed manner.</p>

  <p>Amans<a id="NtA_337" href="#Nt_337"><sup>[337]</sup></a> has suggested that the mechanism of
  flight of the dragon-fly would form a suitable model for a flying-machine, to be propelled by

  <p>The Zygopterides&mdash;the second of the two divisions of the Odonata&mdash;are Insects
  different in many respects from the large and robust Anisopterides. The division comprises the
  delicate Insects called "demoiselles," damsel-flies, by the French (Fig. 262, A, and Fig. 264).
  Great power of flight is not possessed by these more fragile Insects; they flit about in the most
  gentle and airy manner from stem to stem of the aquatic plants and grasses that flourish in the
  localities they love. To this group belong the fairy-like Insects of the genus <i>Calepteryx</i>,
  in which various parts of the body and wings are suffused with exquisite <span class="pagenum"
  id="page418"><span class="smaller">{418}</span></span>metallic tints, while sometimes the two
  sexes of one species have differently coloured wings. The smallest and most delicate dragon-flies
  that are known are found in the tropics; some of the genera allied to <i>Agrion</i> consist of
  Insects of extraordinary fragility and delicacy.</p>

  <p>Although the mature Odonata are so pre-eminently endowed for an aerial and active life, yet in
  the earlier stages of their existence they are very different; they are then, without exception,
  of aquatic habits; though carnivorous also in this period of their existence, they are sluggish in
  movement, lurking in concealment and capturing their prey by means of a peculiar conformation of
  the mouth, that we shall subsequently describe. Their life-histories are only very imperfectly
  known.</p>

  <p>The eggs are deposited either in the water or in the stem of some aquatic plant, the female
  Insect occasionally undergoing submersion in order to accomplish the act. The young on hatching
  are destitute of any traces of wings (Fig. 265), and the structure of the thoracic segments is
  totally different from what it is in the adult, the rectal respiratory system (Fig. 265, <i>x</i>)
  to which we shall subsequently allude, being, however, already present. The wings are said to make
  their first appearance only at the third or fourth moult. At this time the pleura of the second
  and third thoracic segments have grown in a peculiar manner so as to form a lateral plate (Fig.
  266, B, shows this plate at a later stage), and the wing-pads appear as small projections from the
  membranes at the upper margins of these pleural plates (Fig. 266, A, B). The plates increase in
  size during the subsequent stadia, and meet over the bases of the wing-pads, which also become
  much longer than they were at first. The number of moults that occur during growth has not been
  observed in the case of any species, but they are believed to be numerous. There is no pupa, nor
  is there any well-marked quiescent stage preceding the assumption of the winged form at the last
  ecdysis, although at the latter part of its life the nymph appears to be more inactive than usual.
  When full grown, the nymph is more like the future perfect Insect than it was at first, and
  presents the appearance shown in Figs. 266 and 270. At this stage it crawls out of the water and
  clings to some support such as the stem or leaf of an aquatic plant; a few minutes after doing so
  the skin of the back of the thoracic region splits, and the imago emerges from the nymphal
  skin.</p>

  <p>The nymphs never have the body so elongate as the perfect Insect, the difference in this
  respect being frequently great, and the nymphs of the subfamily Libellulinae being very broad
  (Fig. 266, nymph of <i>Ictinus</i> sp.); consequently the creature on emergence from the
  nymph-skin is very much shorter than it will soon become. Extension begins to take place almost
  immediately; it has been thought by some that this is accomplished by swallowing air; this is,
  however, uncertain. At first the wings have only the length of the wing-pads of the nymph, and
  their apical portion is an unformed mass. The colour of the perfect Insect is not present when the
  emergence takes place. The wing grows quickly until the full length is attained. In the genus
  <i>Agrion</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page420"><span class="smaller">{420}</span></span>the
  expansion of the wings is accompanied by frequent elevations and depressions of the body, and
  occupies an hour or so; the elongation of the abdomen is not so soon completed, and its brilliant
  colours do not appear for several hours.</p>

  <p>The mouth of the nymph bears a remarkable structure called the mask (Fig. 268). It is
  apparently formed by a backward growth of the bases of the labium and lingua, a hinge being formed
  between the two at the most posterior point of their growth. The prolonged portions of these parts
  are free: usually the mask is folded under the head, but it can be unfolded and thrust forward,
  remaining then attached to the head by means of the more anterior parts of the lingua and by the
  maxillae, the whole of the elongate apparatus being, when used, extended from this anterior part
  of its attachment. The front parts of the labium form a prehensile apparatus armed with sharp
  teeth, so that the structures make altogether a very effectual trap, that can be extended in order
  to secure the prey.</p>

  <p>The fact that the dragon-fly passes suddenly, in the middle of its existence, from an aquatic
  to an aerial life, makes the condition of its respiratory organs a subject for inquiry of more
  than usual interest. R&eacute;aumur was of opinion that the nymph was, in spite of its aquatic existence,
  provided with an extensive system of stigmata or orifices for breathing air; this was, however,
  denied by Dufour, and his opinion seemed to be supported by the fact that other means of obtaining
  air were discovered to exist in these nymphs. The inquiries connected with the respiration <span
  class="pagenum" id="page421"><span class="smaller">{421}</span></span>of Odonata are still very
  incomplete, but some interesting points have been ascertained, the most important of which is
  perhaps the existence in some forms of a respiratory system in connexion with the posterior part
  of the alimentary canal (Fig. 269). In the nymphs of Anisopterides the system consists of four
  main tracheal trunks, traversing the length of the body, and by their ramifications and
  inosculations forming an extensive apparatus. Connected with the four main trunks we have
  described, there is a shorter pair confined to the abdomen, where it supplies a large number of
  branches to the walls of the stomach. The dorsal pair of the main tubes give numerous subsidiary
  branches to the outside of the rectum, and the ventral pair furnish a smaller number. The walls of
  the gut are penetrated by the branches, which inside the rectum form numerous loops; these,
  covered by a membrane, project into the interior in the form of multitudinous papillae
  (&AElig;schninae). In the Libellulinae the papillae are replaced by more flattened processes or
  lamellae. The structures attain a remarkable development, there being in <i>Aeschna cyanea</i>
  upwards of 24,000 papillae.</p>

  <p>These rectal gills obtain air from water admitted into the rectum for the purpose; the
  extremity of the body being armed with projections of variable form, that can be separated to
  allow ingress and egress of the fluid, or brought into close apposition so as to close the
  orifice. The water so taken in can, by some species, be ejected with force, and is used
  occasionally as a means of locomotion. These rectal branchiae can absorb free air, as well as air
  dissolved in water. If the fluid in which the creatures are placed has been previously boiled, so
  as to expel the air from it, the nymphs then thrust the <span class="pagenum" id="page422"><span
  class="smaller">{422}</span></span>extremity of the body out of the water and so obtain a supply
  of air.</p>

  <p>Oustalet and Palm&eacute;n state that at the last ecdysis the lamellae, or the papillae, do not
  disappear, but remain quite empty, and are consequently functionless, while on the tracheal trunks
  there are developed air vesicles to fit the creature for its aerial career. Hagen says that in
  <i>Epitheca</i> the whole structure of the gills is shed at the final moult.</p>

  <p>The subject of the rectal branchiae of <i>Libellula</i> has been discussed and illustrated by
  Chun,<a id="NtA_338" href="#Nt_338"><sup>[338]</sup></a> who states that Leydig has made known
  that in <i>Phryganea grandis</i> a structure is found connecting the rectal branchiae of
  <i>Libellula</i> with the rectal glands of some other Insects. We have not been able to find a
  confirmation of this in the writings of Leydig or elsewhere.</p>

  <p>In the nymphs of the Zygopterides the highly-developed rectal branchiae found in the Aeschninae
  and Libellulinae do not exist, and the respiration seems to be of a complex character. In one
  division of the Zygopterides&mdash;Calepteryginae&mdash;rectal gills of an imperfect character are
  said by Hagen and others to exist.<a id="NtA_339" href="#Nt_339"><sup>[339]</sup></a> The nymphs
  of the Zygopterides are provided with three mobile processes at the extremity of the body (Fig.
  270); these serve the purposes of locomotion. They are believed to possess also a respiratory
  function, but this must be of an accessory nature, for the nymphs live after the removal of the
  processes, and indeed reproduce them; the skin of these processes is harder than is usual in
  Insect gills. In the nymph of <i>Euphaea</i>&mdash;a genus of Calepteryginae found in tropical
  Asia&mdash;there are also external <span class="pagenum" id="page423"><span
  class="smaller">{423}</span></span>abdominal gills, and in this case respiration may, according to
  Hagen,<a id="NtA_340" href="#Nt_340"><sup>[340]</sup></a> take place in four different manners:
  (1) by ten pairs of stigmata; (2) by lateral branchiae well furnished with tracheae; (3) by caudal
  branchiae; (4) by rectal branchiae. It is further said that in this Insect the lateral branchiae
  persist in the imago.</p>

  <p>Although the means of respiration of the nymphs have been fairly well ascertained, yet the mode
  in which the nymph is prepared for the sudden change from the aquatic to aerial life is still
  obscure, the condition of the stigmata not being thoroughly elucidated. It appears probable,
  however, that the young nymph has no stigmata; that these organs appear in the course of its
  development, being at first quite impervious, but becoming&mdash;at any rate in the case of the
  larger and more important pair&mdash;open previous to the final ecdysis. We have mentioned the
  contradictory opinions of R&eacute;aumur and Dufour, and will now add the views of some modern
  investigators. Oustalet says<a id="NtA_341" href="#Nt_341"><sup>[341]</sup></a> that there are two
  pairs of spiracles in the nymphs; the first pair is quite visible to the naked eye, and is situate
  between pro- and meso-notum; it is in the nymph closed by a membrane. The other pair of spiracles
  is placed above the posterior pair of legs, is small and completely closed. He does not state what
  stage of growth was attained by the nymphs he examined. Palm&eacute;n was of opinion that not only
  thoracic but abdominal spiracles exist in the nymph,<a id="NtA_342"
  href="#Nt_342"><sup>[342]</sup></a> and that they are completely closed so that no air enters
  them; he says that the spiracles have tracheae connected with them, that at each moult the part
  closing the spiracles is shed with some of the tracheal exuviae attached to it. The breathing
  orifices are therefore for a short time at each ecdysis open, being subsequently again closed by
  some exudation or secretion. This view of Palm&eacute;n's has been thought improbable by Hagen and
  Dewitz, who operated by placing nymphs in alcohol or warm water and observing the escape of
  bubbles from the spots where the supposed breathing orifices are situate. Both these observers
  found much difference in the results obtained in the cases of young and of old nymphs. Hagen
  concludes that the first pair of thoracic spiracles are functionally active, and that abdominal
  stigmata exist though <span class="pagenum" id="page424"><span
  class="smaller">{424}</span></span>functionless; he appears to be of opinion that when the first
  thoracic stigma is closed this is the result of the abutting against it of a closed trachea.
  Dewitz found<a id="NtA_343" href="#Nt_343"><sup>[343]</sup></a> that in the adult nymph of
  <i>Aeschna</i> the thoracic stigma is well developed, while the other stigmata&mdash;to what
  number and in what position is not stated&mdash;are very small. In a half-grown Aeschnid nymph he
  found the thoracic stigma to be present in an undeveloped form. On placing a full-grown nymph in
  alcohol, gas escaped from the stigma in question, but in immature nymphs no escape of gas occurred
  although they were subjected to a severe test. A specimen that, when submitted to the
  above-mentioned immersion, emitted gas, subsequently moulted, and thereafter air escaped from the
  spiracle previously impervious. The observations of Hagen and Dewitz are perhaps not so adverse to
  the views of Palm&eacute;n as has been supposed, so that it would not be a matter for surprise if
  Palm&eacute;n's views on this point should be shown to be quite correct.</p>

  <p>The number of species of Odonata or Libellulidae that have been described is somewhat less than
  two thousand, but constant additions are made to the number, and when the smaller and more fragile
  forms from the tropics are collected and worked out it will probably be found that the number of
  existing species is somewhere between five and ten thousand. They are distributed all over the
  world, but are most numerous in species in the warmer regions, and their predominance in any one
  locality is very much regulated by the existence of waters suitable for the early stages of their
  lives.</p>

  <p>A good work on the British Odonata is still a desideratum.<a id="NtA_344"
  href="#Nt_344"><sup>[344]</sup></a> In Britain about forty-six species are believed to be native.
  They are said to be of late years less numerous than they used to be. Notwithstanding their great
  powers of flight, dragon-flies are destroyed by birds of various kinds; several hawks are said to
  be very fond of them, and <i>Merops persicus</i> to line its nest with their wings. The number of
  Insects killed by dragon-flies in places where they are abundant must be enormous; the nymphs,
  too, <span class="pagenum" id="page425"><span class="smaller">{425}</span></span>are very
  destructive in the waters they inhabit, so that dragon-flies have no doubt been no mean factor in
  maintaining that important and delicate balance of life which it is so difficult for us to
  appreciate. The nymphs are no doubt cannibals, and this may perhaps be an advantage to the
  species, as the eggs are sometimes deposited in large numbers in a limited body of water, where
  all must perish if the nymphs did not, after exhausting other food, attack one another. Martin,
  speaking of the Odonata of the D&eacute;partement de l'Indre in France, says:<a id="NtA_345"
  href="#Nt_345"><sup>[345]</sup></a> "The eggs, larvae, and nymphs are the prey of several fishes,
  snakes, newts, Coleoptera, aquatic Hemiptera, and of some diving birds. Sometimes the destruction
  is on a considerable scale, and one may notice the dragon-flies of some piece of water to diminish
  gradually in numbers, while the animals that prey on them increase, so that a species may for a
  time entirely disappear in a particular spot, owing to the attacks of some enemy that has been
  specially prosperous, and also eager in their pursuit. De Selys found that from a pond filled with
  carp, roach, perch, and eels, several of the dragon-fly denizens disappeared directly the bream
  was introduced." On the other hand, there can be little doubt that the nymphs are sometimes
  injurious to fish; it has been recorded that in a piscicultural establishment in Hungary 50,000
  young fishes were put into a pond in spring; in the following autumn only fifty-four fish could be
  found, but there were present an enormous quantity of dragon-fly nymphs.</p>

  <p>Odonata are among the few kinds of Insects that are known to form swarms and migrate. Swarms of
  this kind have been frequently observed in Europe and in North America; they usually consist of
  species of the genus <i>Libellula</i>, but species of various other genera also swarm, and
  sometimes a swarm may consist of more than one species. <i>L. quadrimaculata</i> is the species
  that perhaps most frequently forms these swarms in Europe; a large migration of this species is
  said to occur every year in the Charente inf&eacute;rieure from north to south.<a id="NtA_346"
  href="#Nt_346"><sup>[346]</sup></a> It is needless to say that the instincts and stimuli connected
  with these migrations are not understood.</p>

  <p>The nymphs are capable, under certain circumstances, of accommodating themselves to very
  peculiar conditions of life. The Sandwich Islands are extremely poor in stagnant waters, and <span
  class="pagenum" id="page426"><span class="smaller">{426}</span></span>yet there exist in this
  remote archipelago several highly peculiar species of Agrioninae. Mr. R. C. L. Perkins has
  recently discovered that the nymphs of some of these are capable of maintaining their existence
  and completing their development in the small collections of water that accumulate in the leaves
  of some lilies growing on dry land. These nymphs (Fig. 271) have a shorter mask than occurs, we
  believe, in any other Odonata, and one would suppose that they must frequently wait long for a
  meal, as they must be dependent on stray Insects becoming immersed in these tiny reservoirs. The
  cannibal habits of the Odonata probably stand these lily-dwellers in good stead; Mr. Perkins found
  that there were sometimes two or three nymphs of different sizes together, and we may suspect that
  it sometimes goes hard with the smaller fry. The extension in the length of the body of one of
  these lily-frequenting Agrions when it leaves the water for its aerial existence is truly
  extraordinary.</p>

  <p>The Odonata have no close relations with any other group of Insects. They were associated by
  Latreille with the Ephemeridae, in a family called Subulicornia. The members of the two groups
  have, in fact, a certain resemblance in some of the features of their lives, especially in the
  sudden change, without intermediate condition, from aquatic to aerial life; but in all important
  points of structure, and in their dispositions, dragon-flies and may-flies are totally dissimilar,
  and there is no intermediate group to connect them. We have already, said that the Odonata consist
  of two very distinct divisions&mdash;Anisopterides and Zygopterides. The former group comprises
  the subfamilies Gomphinae, Cordulegasterinae, Aeschninae, Corduliinae, and
  Libellulinae,&mdash;Insects having the hinder wings slightly larger than the anterior pair; while
  the Zygopterides consist of only two subfamilies&mdash;Calepteryginae and Agrioninae; they have
  the wings of the two pairs equal in size, or the hinder a little the smaller. The two groups
  Gomphinae and Calepteryginae are each, in several respects, of lower development than the others,
  and authorities are divided <span class="pagenum" id="page427"><span
  class="smaller">{427}</span></span>in opinion as to which of the two should be considered the more
  primitive. It is therefore of much interest to find that there exists an Insect that shares the
  characters of the two primitive subfamilies in a striking manner. This Insect, <i>Palaeophlebia
  superstes</i> (Fig. 272), has recently been discovered in Japan, and is perhaps the most
  interesting dragon-fly yet obtained. De Selys Longchamps refers it to the subfamily
  Calepteryginae, on account of the nature of its wings; were the Insect, however, deprived of these
  organs, no one would think of referring <i>Palaeophlebia</i> to the group in question, for it has
  the form, colour, and appearance of a Gomphine Odonate. Moreover, the two sexes differ in an
  important character,&mdash;the form of the head and eyes. In this respect the female resembles a
  Gomphine of inferior development; while the male, by the shape and large size of the ocular
  organs, may be considered to combine the characters of Gomphinae and Calepteryginae. The Insect is
  very remarkable in colour, the large eyes being red in the dead examples. We do not, however, know
  what may be their colour during life, as only one pair of the species is known, and there is no
  record as to the life-history and habits. De Selys considers the nearest ally of this Insect to be
  <i>Heterophlebia dislocata</i>, a fossil dragon-fly found in the Lower Lias of England.</p>

  <p>Numerous fossil dragon-flies are known; the group is well represented in the Tertiary strata,
  and specimens have been found in amber. In strata of the Secondary age these Insects <span
  class="pagenum" id="page428"><span class="smaller">{428}</span></span>have been found as far back
  as the Lower Lias; their remains are said to exist in considerable variety in the strata of that
  epoch, and some of them to testify to the existence at that period of dragon-flies as highly
  specialised as those now living. According to Hagen<a id="NtA_347"
  href="#Nt_347"><sup>[347]</sup></a> <i>Platephemera antiqua</i> and <i>Gerephemera simplex</i>,
  two Devonian fossils, may be considered as dragon-flies; the evidence as to this appears
  inadequate, and Brongniart refers the latter Insect to the family Platypterides, and considers
  Platephemera to be more allied to the may-flies.</p>

  <p class="sp5">One of the most remarkable of the numerous discoveries lately made in fossil
  entomology is the finding of remains of huge Insects, evidently allied to dragon-flies, in the
  Carboniferous strata at Commentry. Brongniart calls these Insects Protodonates,<a id="NtA_348"
  href="#Nt_348"><sup>[348]</sup></a> and looks on them as the precursors of our Odonata.
  <i>Meganeura monyi</i> was the largest of these Insects, and measured over two feet across the
  expanded wings. If M. Brongniart be correct in his restoration of this giant of the Insect world,
  it much resembled our existing dragon-flies, but had a simple structure of the thoracic segments,
  and a simpler system of wing-nervures. On <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page276">276</a></span>
  we figured <i>Titanophasma fayoli</i>, considered by Scudder and Brongniart as allied to the
  family Phasmidae, and we pointed out that this supposed alliance must at best have been very
  remote. This view is now taken by M. Brongniart himself,<a id="NtA_349"
  href="#Nt_349"><sup>[349]</sup></a> he having removed the Insect from the Protophasmides to locate
  it in the Protodonates near Meganeura. There appears to be some doubt whether the wings supposed
  to belong to this specimen were really such, or belonged rather to some other species.</p>

  <p>The may-flies are well known&mdash;in literature&mdash;as the types of a brief and ineffective
  life.  This supposed brevity relates solely to their existence in the winged form.  In the earlier
  stages the may-fly is so unlike its subsequent self that it is not recognised as a may-fly by the
  uninitiated.  The total life of the individual is really quite as long as that of most <span
  class="pagenum" id="page430"><span class="smaller">{430}</span></span>other Insects. The earlier
  stages and life-histories of these Insects are of great importance. The perfect Insects are so
  delicate and fragile that they shrivel much in drying, and are very difficult to preserve in a
  condition suitable for study.</p>

  <p>The mouth of the imago is atrophied, the trophi scarcely existing as separate parts. Packard
  says that in <i>Palingenia bilineata</i> he could discover no certain traces of any of the
  mouth-parts, but in <i>Leptophlebia cupida</i> he found, as he thought, the rudiments of the
  maxillae and labium, though not of the mandibles. The antennae are always short, and consist of
  one or two thick basal joints succeeded by a delicate needle-like segment, which, though
  comparatively long, is not divided. The ocular organs are remarkable for their large size and
  complex development; they are always larger in the male than they are in the female. The compound
  eyes of the former sex are in certain species, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Clo&euml;on</i> (Fig. 274), quite
  divided, so that each eye becomes a pair of organs of a different character; one part forms a
  pillar facetted at its summit, while the other part remains as a true eye placed on the side of
  the head; in front of these compound eyes there are three ocelli. Thus the Insect comes to have
  three different kinds of eyes, together seven in number.</p>

  <p>The prothorax is small, the pronotum being, however, quite distinct. The mesothorax is very
  large; its notum forms by far the larger part of the upper surface of the thoracic region, the
  metathorax being small and different in structure, resembling in appearance a part of the abdomen,
  so that the hind wings look as if they were attached to a first abdominal segment. The mesosternum
  is also disproportionately large in comparison with the homologous piece preceding it, and with
  that following it. The pleural pieces are large, but their structure and disposition are only very
  imperfectly understood. The coxae are small and are widely separated, the anterior being, however,
  more elongate and approximate than the others. The other parts of the legs are slender; the number
  of joints in the tarsi varies from five to one. <span class="pagenum" id="page431"><span
  class="smaller">{431}</span></span>The legs throughout the family exhibit a considerable variety
  of structure, and the front pair in the males of some species are remarkably long. The abdomen is
  usually slender, and consists of ten segments; the terminal one bears three, or two, very long
  flexible appendages. The first dorsal plate of the abdomen is either wanting or is concealed to a
  considerable extent by the metanotum. The wings are peculiar; the anterior pair vary a great deal
  in their width, but are never very long in proportion to the width; the hind pair are always
  disproportionately small, and sometimes are quite wanting. The venation consists of a few, or of a
  moderate number, of delicate longitudinal veins that do not pursue a tortuous course, but
  frequently are gracefully curved, and form a system of approximately similar curves, most of the
  veins being of considerable length; close to the anterior margin of the wing there are two or
  three sub-parallel veins. Frequently there are very numerous fine, short cross-veinlets, but these
  vary greatly and may be entirely wanting.</p>

  <p>The earlier stages of the life of Ephemeridae are, it is believed, in the case of all the
  species, aquatic. May-flies, indeed, during the period of their post-embryonic development are
  more modified for an aquatic life than any other Insects, and are provided with a complex
  apparatus of tracheal gills. The eggs are committed to the waters without any care or foresight on
  the part of the parent flies, thus the embryonic development is also aquatic; little, however, is
  known of it. According to Joly<a id="NtA_350" href="#Nt_350"><sup>[350]</sup></a> the process in
  <i>Palingenia virgo</i> is slow. The larva on emerging from the egg has no respiratory system,
  neither could Joly detect any circulation or any nervous system. The creature on emergence is very
  like <i>Campodea</i> in form, possessing long antennae and tails&mdash;caudal setae. Owing to the
  organisation being inferior, the creature in its earlier stages is called a larvule; in its later
  stages <span class="pagenum" id="page432"><span class="smaller">{432}</span></span>it is usually
  spoken of as a nymph, but the term larva is also frequently applied to it. Soon the gills begin to
  appear in the form of small tubular caeca placed in the posterior and upper angles of the
  abdominal rings; in fifteen days the gills begin to assume their characteristic form, are
  penetrated by tracheae, and the circulation can be seen. The amount of growth accomplished after
  hatching between March and September is but small.</p>

  <p>The metamorphosis of <i>Clo&euml;on</i> has been described by Sir John Lubbock; he informs us that
  the young creature undergoes a constant and progressive development, going through a series of
  more than twenty moults, each accompanied by a slight change of form or structure. His
  observations were made on captured <span class="pagenum" id="page433"><span

  id="NtA_352" href="#Nt_352"><sup>[352]</sup></a> the first stage is really such. He found no
  tracheae in the earliest stages; the small first rudiments of the gills became visible in the
  third stage, when there were no tracheae; the fourth instar possessed tracheae, and they could be
  seen in the gills. The wing rudiments could first be detected in the ninth and tenth stages. The
  changes of skin during the winter months are separated by longer intervals than those occurring at

  <p>The nymphs differ greatly in the structure and arrangement of their tracheal gills, and display

  body, and frequently processes projecting forwards from the head: examples, <i>Ephemera</i> (Fig.
  278) and <i>Palingenia</i>. (2) Flat larvae: these live attached to rocks, but run with rapidity
  when disturbed; they prefer rapid streams, have the breathing organs attached to the sides of the
  body and not reposing on the back; they are exclusively carnivorous, while the fossorial forms are
  believed to obtain their nutriment by eating mud: example, <i>Ba&euml;tis</i>. (3) Swimming larvae:
  elongate delicate creatures, with feeble legs, and with strongly ciliated caudal setae: example,
  <i>Clo&euml;on</i> (Fig. 276). (4) Climbing larvae: these live in slowly-moving waters, especially such
  as have much slimy mud in suspension, and they have a habit of covering themselves with this mud

  <p>The anatomy of the nymphs has been treated by Vayssi&egrave;re,<a id="NtA_354"
  href="#Nt_354"><sup>[354]</sup></a> who arranges them in five groups in accordance with the
  conditions of the tracheal gills: (1) The gills are of large size, are exposed and furnished at
  the sides with respiratory fringes: example, <i>Ephemera</i> (Fig. 278). (2) The branchiae are
  blade-like, not fringed, and are exposed at the sides of the body: example, <i>Clo&euml;on</i> (Fig.
  276). (3) The respiratory tubes are placed on the under surface of plates whose upper surface is
  not respiratory: example, <i>Oligoneuria garumnica</i> (Fig. 279). (4) The anterior gill is
  modified to form a plate that covers the others: example, <i>Tricorythus</i> (Fig. 282, B). (5)
  The gills are concealed in a respiratory chamber: example, <i>Prosopistoma</i> (Fig. 280). The
  last of these nymphs is more completely adapted for an aquatic life than any other Insect at
  present known; it was for long supposed to be a Crustacean, but it has now been shown to be the
  early stage of a may-fly, the sub-imago having been reared from the nymph. The carapace by which
  the larger part of the body is covered is formed by the union of the pro- and meso-thorax with the
  sheaths of the anterior wings, which have an unusually extensive development; under the carapace
  there is a respiratory chamber, the floor and sides of which are formed by the posterior
  wing-sheaths, and by a large plate composed of the united nota of the metathorax and the first six
  abdominal segments. In this chamber there are placed five pairs of tracheal gills; entrance of
  water to the chamber is effected by two laterally-placed orifices, and exit by a single dorsal
  aperture. These nymphs use the body as a sucker, and so adhere strongly to stones under water.
  When detached they swim rapidly by means of their caudal setae; the form of these latter organs is
  different from that <span class="pagenum" id="page435"><span class="smaller">{435}</span></span>of
  other Ephemerid nymphs.  This point and other details of the anatomy of this creature have been

  have a very highly developed tracheal system; they live in rapid watercourses attached to stones

      entrance <i>a</i>; <i>b</i>, blood-vessel of the left caudal process; <b>B</b>, twenty-sixth

      <i>o</i>, orifice in the latter. (After Zimmermann.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The internal anatomy of the nymphs of Ephemeridae shows some points of extreme interest. The
  long caudal setae are respiratory organs of a kind that is almost if not quite without parallel in
  the other divisions of Insecta. The dorsal vessel for the circulation of the blood is elongate,
  and its chambers are arranged one to each segment of the body. It drives the blood forwards in the
  usual manner, but the posterior chamber possesses three blood-vessels, one of which is prolonged
  into each caudal seta. This terminal chamber is so arranged as to drive the blood backwards into
  the vessels of the setae; on the under surface of the vessels there are oval orifices by which the
  blood escapes into the cavity of the seta so as to be submitted to the action of the surrounding
  medium for some of the purposes of respiration. This structure has been described by <span

  <p>The nymphs of the Ephemeridae being creatures adapted for existence in water, the details of
  their transformation into creatures having an entirely aerial existence cannot but be of much
  interest. In the nymphs the tracheal system is well developed, but differs from that of
  air-breathing Insects in the total absence of any spiracles. Palm&eacute;n has investigated this
  subject,<a id="NtA_360" href="#Nt_360"><sup>[360]</sup></a> and finds that the main longitudinal
  tracheal trunks of the body of the nymph are not connected with the skin of the body by tracheae,
  but are attached thereto by ten pairs of slender strings extending between the chitinous
  integument and the tracheal trunks. When the skin is shed these strings&mdash;or rather a
  chitinous axis in each one&mdash;are drawn out of the body, and bring with them the chitinous
  linings of the tracheae. Thus notwithstanding the absence of spiracles, the body wall is at each
  moult pierced by openings that extend to the tracheae. After the ordinary moults these orifices
  close immediately, but at the change to the winged state they remain open and form the spiracles.
  At the same time the tracheal gills are <span class="pagenum" id="page437"><span
  class="smaller">{437}</span></span>completely shed, and the creature is thus transformed from a
  water-breather to an Insect breathing air as usual. In addition to this change there are others of
  great importance, such as the development of the great eyes and the complete atrophy of the
  mouth-parts. The precise manner of these changes is not known; they occur, however, within the
  nymph skin. The sudden emergence of the winged Insect from the nymph is one of the most remarkable
  facts in the life-history of the may-fly; it has been observed by Sir John Lubbock,<a id="NtA_361"
  href="#Nt_361"><sup>[361]</sup></a> who describes it as almost instantaneous. The nymph floats on
  the water, the skin of the back opens, and the winged Insect flies out, upwards and away; "from
  the moment when the skin first cracks not ten seconds are over before the Insect has flown away."
  The creature that thus escapes has not, however, quite completed its transformation. It is still
  enveloped in a skin that compresses and embarrasses it; this it therefore rapidly gets rid of, and
  thus becomes the imago, or final instar of the life-cycle. The instar in which the creature exists
  winged and active, though covered with a skin, is called the sub-imago. The parts of the body in
  the sub-imago are as a whole smaller than they are in the imago, and the colour is more dingy; the
  appendages&mdash;wings, legs, and caudal setae&mdash;are generally considerably shorter than they
  are in the imago, but attain their full length during the process of extraction. The creatures
  being, according to Riley, very impatient and eager to take to the wing, the completion of the
  shedding of the skin of the sub-imago is sometimes performed while the Insect is flying in the
  air.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The food of young Ephemeridae is apparently of a varied and mixed nature. Eaton says<a
  id="NtA_362" href="#Nt_362"><sup>[362]</sup></a> that though sometimes the stronger larvae devour
  the weaker, yet the diet is even in these cases partly vegetable. The alimentary canal frequently
  contains much mud; very small organisms, such as diatoms and confervae, are thought to form a
  large part of the bill of fare of Ephemerid nymphs. Although <span class="pagenum"
  id="page438"><span class="smaller">{438}</span></span>the mouth is atrophied in the imago, yet it
  is highly developed in the nymphs. This is especially notable in the case of the lingua or
  hypopharynx (Fig. 283); indeed Vayssi&egrave;re<a id="NtA_363" href="#Nt_363"><sup>[363]</sup></a> seems
  to incline to the opinion that this part of the mouth may be looked on in these Insects as a pair
  of appendages of a head-segment (see <span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page96">96</a></span>
  <i>ante</i>), like the labium or maxillae.</p>

  <p>The life-history has not been fully ascertained in the case of any species of may-fly; it is
  known, however, that the development of the nymph sometimes occupies a considerable period, and it
  is thought that in the case of some species this extends to as much as three years. It is rare to
  find the post-embryonic development of an Insect occupying so long a period, so that we are
  justified in saying that brief as may be the life of the may-fly itself, the period of preparation
  for it is longer than usual. R&eacute;aumur says, speaking of the winged fly, that its life is so short
  that some species never see the sun. Their emergence from the nymph-skin taking place at sunset,
  the duties of the generation have been, so far as these individuals are concerned, completed
  before the morning, and they die before sunrise. He thinks, indeed, that individuals living thus
  long are to be looked on as Methuselahs among their fellows, most of whom, he says, live only an
  hour or half an hour.<a id="NtA_364" href="#Nt_364"><sup>[364]</sup></a> It is by no means clear
  to which species these remarks of R&eacute;aumur refer; they are doubtless correct in certain cases, but
  in others the life of the adult is not so very short, and in some species may, in all probability,
  extend over three or four days; indeed, if the weather undergo an unfavourable change so as to
  keep them motionless, the life of the flies may be prolonged for a fortnight.</p>

  <p>The life of the imago of the may-fly is as remarkable as it is brief; in order to comprehend it
  we must refer to certain peculiarities of the anatomy with which the vital phenomena are
  connected. The more important of these are the large eyes of the males, the structure of the
  alimentary canal, and that of the reproductive organs. We have already remarked that the parts of
  the mouth in the imago are atrophied, yet the canal itself not only exists but is even of greater
  capacity than usual; it appears to have much the same general arrangement of parts as it had in
  the nymph. Its coats are, however, of great tenuity, and according <span class="pagenum"
  id="page439"><span class="smaller">{439}</span></span>to Palm&eacute;n<a id="NtA_365"
  href="#Nt_365"><sup>[365]</sup></a> the divisions of the canal are separated by changes in the
  direction of certain portions anterior to, and of others posterior to, its central and greater
  part&mdash;the stomach&mdash;in such a manner that the portions with diverted positions act as
  valves. The stomach, in fact, forms in the interior of the body a delicate capacious sac; when
  movement tends to increase the capacity of the body cavity then air enters into the stomachic sac
  by the mouth orifice, but when muscular contractions result in pressure on the sac they close the
  orifices of its extremities by the valve-like structures we have mentioned above; the result is,
  that as complex movements of the body are made the stomach becomes more and more distended by air.
  It was known even to the old naturalists that the dancing may-fly is a sort of balloon, but they
  were not acquainted with the exact mode of inflation. Palm&eacute;n says that in addition to the
  valve-like arrangements we have described, the entry to the canal is controlled by a circular
  muscle, with which are connected radiating muscles attached to the walls of the head. Palm&eacute;n's
  views are adopted, and to a certain extent confirmed, by Fritze,<a id="NtA_366"
  href="#Nt_366"><sup>[366]</sup></a> who has examined the alimentary canal of the may-fly, and
  considers that though the normal parts of the canal exist, the function is changed in the imago,
  in which the canal serves as a sort of balloon, and aids the function of the reproductive organs.
  The change in the canal takes place in an anticipatory manner during the nymph and sub-imago
  stages.</p>

  <p>The sexual organs of Ephemeridae are remarkable for their simplicity; they are destitute of the
  accessory glands and diverticula that, in some form or other, are present in most other Insects.
  Still more remarkable is the fact that the ducts by which they communicate with the exterior
  continue as a pair to the extremity of the body, and do not, as in other Insects, unite into a
  common duct. Thus in the female there is neither bursa copulatrix, receptaculum seminis, nor
  uterine portion of oviduct, and there is no trace of an ovipositor; the terminations of the ducts
  are placed at the hind margin of the seventh ventral plate, just in front of which they are
  connected by a fold of the integument. The ovary consists of a very large number of small
  egg-tubes seated on one side of a sac, which forms their calyx, and one of whose extremities is
  continued backwards as one of the <span class="pagenum" id="page440"><span
  class="smaller">{440}</span></span>pair of oviducts. The male has neither vesiculae seminales,
  accessory glands, nor ductus ejaculatorius. The testes are elongate sacs, whose extremities are
  prolonged backwards forming the vasa deferentia; these open separately at the extremity of the
  body, each on a separate intromittent projection of more or less complex character, the two organs
  being, however, connected by means of the ninth ventral plate, of which they are, according to
  Palm&eacute;n, appendages. We should remark that this authority considers <i>Heptagenia</i> to form, to
  some extent, an exception as regards the structures of the female; while <i>Polymitarcys</i> is in
  the male sex strongly aberrant, as the two vasa deferentia, instead of being approximately
  straight, are bent inwards at right angles near their extremities so as to meet, and form in the
  middle a common cavity, which then again becomes double to pass into the pair of intromittent
  organs.</p>

  <p>According to the views of Exner and others, the compound eyes of Insects are chiefly organs for
  the perception of movement; if this view be correct, movements such as those made during the
  dances of may-flies may, by the number of the separate eyes, by their curved surfaces and
  innumerable facets, be multiplied and correlated in a manner of which our own sense of sight
  allows us to form no conception. We can see on a summer's evening how beautifully and gracefully a
  crowd of may-flies dance, and we may well believe that to the marvellous ocular organs of the
  flies themselves (Fig. 274) these movements form a veritable ballet. We have pointed out that by
  this dancing the peculiarly formed alimentary canal becomes distended, and may now add that Palm&eacute;n
  and Fritze believe that the unique structure of the reproductive organs is also correlated with
  the other anatomical peculiarities, the contents of the sexual glands being driven along the
  simple and direct ducts by the expansion of the balloon-like stomach. During these dances the
  momentary conjugation of the sexes occurs, and immediately thereafter the female, according to
  Eaton, resorts to the waters appropriate for the deposition of her eggs. As regards this, Eaton
  says:<a id="NtA_367" href="#Nt_367"><sup>[367]</sup></a> "Some short-lived species discharge the
  contents of their ovaries completely <i>en masse</i>, and the pair of fusiform or subcylindrical
  egg-clusters laid upon the water rapidly disintegrate, so as to let the eggs sink broadcast upon
  the river-bed. The less perishable species extrude their eggs <span class="pagenum"
  id="page441"><span class="smaller">{441}</span></span>gradually, part at a time, and deposit them
  in one or other of the following manners: either the mother alights upon the water at intervals to
  wash off the eggs that have issued from the mouths of the oviducts during her flight, or else she
  creeps down into the water to lay her eggs upon the under-side of stones, disposing them in
  rounded patches, in a single layer evenly spread, and in mutual contiguity." The eggs are very
  numerous, and it is thought may sometimes remain in the water as much as six or seven months
  before they hatch.</p>

  <p>The number of individuals produced by some kinds of may-flies is remarkable. Swarms consisting
  of millions of individuals are occasionally witnessed. D'Albertis observed <i>Palingenia
  papuana</i> in countless myriads on the Fly River in New Guinea: "For miles the surface of the
  river, from side to side, was white with them as they hung over it on gauzy wings; at certain
  moments, obeying some mysterious signal, they would rise in the air, and then sink down anew like
  a fall of snow." He further states that the two sexes were in very disproportionate numbers, and
  estimates that there was but a single female to every five or six thousand males.</p>

  <p>Ephemeridae in the perfect state are a favourite food of fishes, and it is said that on some
  waters it is useless for the fly-fisher to try any other lure when these flies are swarming. Most
  of the "duns" and "spinners" of the angler are Ephemeridae; so are several of the "drakes," our
  large <i>E. danica</i> and <i>E. vulgata</i> being known as the green drake and the gray drake.
  Ronalds says<a id="NtA_368" href="#Nt_368"><sup>[368]</sup></a> that the term "dun" refers to the
  pseud-imago condition, "spinner" to the perfect Insect. <i>E. danica</i> and <i>E. vulgata</i> are
  perhaps not distinguished by fishers; Eaton says that the former is abundant in rapid, cool
  streams, while <i>E. vulgata</i> prefers warmer and more tranquil rivers.</p>

  <p>These sensitive creatures are unable to resist the attractions of artificial lights. R&eacute;aumur
  noticed this fact many years ago, and since the introduction of the electric light, notes may
  frequently be seen in journals recording that myriads of these Insects have been lured by it to
  destruction. Their dances may frequently be observed to take place in peculiar states of light and
  shade, in twilight, or where the sinking sun has its light rendered broken by bushes or trees;
  possibly the broken lights <span class="pagenum" id="page442"><span
  class="smaller">{442}</span></span>are enhanced in effect by the ocular structures of the Insects.
  It has recently been ascertained that a species of <i>Teleganodes</i> is itself luminous. Mr.
  Lewis,<a id="NtA_369" href="#Nt_369"><sup>[369]</sup></a> who observed this Insect in Ceylon,
  states that in life the whole of the abdomen was luminous, not brightly so, but sufficient to
  serve as a guide for capturing the Insect on a dark night. It has also been recorded that the male
  of <i>Caenis dimidiata</i> gives a faint blue light at night.</p>

  <p>Nearly 300 species of Ephemeridae are known, but this may be only a fragment of what actually
  exist, very little being known of may-flies of other parts of the world than Europe and North
  America. One of the more curious forms of the family is <i>Oniscigaster wakefieldi</i>; the body
  of the imago is unusually rotund and furnished with lateral processes. In Britain we have about
  forty species of may-fly. The family is treated as a distinct Order by Brauer and Packard, and is
  called Plectoptera by the latter.</p>

  <p>That Insects so fragile, so highly organised, with a host of powerful enemies, but themselves
  destitute of means of attack or defence, should contrive to exist at all is remarkable; and it
  appears still more unlikely that such delicate Insects as Ephemeridae should leave implanted in
  the rocks their traces in such a manner that they can be recognised; nevertheless, such is the
  case,&mdash;indeed, the may-fly palaeontological record is both rich and remarkable. Several forms
  are preserved in amber. In the Tertiary bed of the old lake at Florissant, Scudder has been able
  to distinguish the remains of no less than six species; while in the Jurassic layers of the
  Secondary epoch, in more than one locality, the remains of several other species have been
  detected and described. Still more remarkable is the fact that in the Devonian and Carboniferous
  layers of the <span class="pagenum" id="page443"><span
  class="smaller">{443}</span></span>Palaeozoic period, remains are found that appear to be akin to
  our existing Ephemeridae. <i>Palingenia feistmantelii</i> from the Carboniferous of Bohemia is
  actually referred to a still existing genus; it is said to have been of gigantic size for a
  may-fly.</p>

  <p>The families Megasecopterides, Platypterides, and Stenodictyopterides of the Carboniferous
  epoch (see p. 343) are all more or less closely allied to the Ephemeridae, and in addition to
  these Brongniart has established the family Protephemerides for some Insects that he considers to
  have been the precursors in the Carboniferous epoch of our existing may-flies. These ancient
  Insects differed in having the wings of another form from those of existing Ephemeridae, and in
  having the hind wings equal in size to the front pair. Besides this, these Insects had, as shown
  in Fig. 285, prothoracic dorsal appendages; some had also projections from the abdominal segments,
  considered by Brongniart to be of the nature of gills. Some doubt must exist as to this point, for
  we find in the imago of one of our existing Ephemeridae, <i>Oniscigaster wakefieldi</i>, Fig. 284,
  abdominal processes that are not gills.</p>

  <p class="sp5">It is remarkable that may-flies, which now form a comparatively unimportant part of

  fragments of an expiring group.</p>

  <p>It is very unattractive in appearance, being of a blackish colour, with wings of a yellow-brown
  tinge, and makes but a poor show when flying. The female deposits patches of elongate eggs, placed
  on end and packed together in a very clever manner (Fig. 287). These patches of eggs, of a
  stone-gray colour, are common objects on rushes or stems of grass near water, and it is stated
  that there may be no less than 2000 or 3000 eggs in one of them. Our figure gives some idea of the
  mode in which the eggs are arranged, and the curious narrow process that exists at the end of
  each. The eggs are said to be sometimes placed at a considerable distance from water, so that when
  the tiny larvae are hatched they must begin their lives by finding the way to a suitable pool or
  stream. The larvae (Fig. 288) are objects of very great interest owing to each of segments 1 to 7
  of the hind body being furnished on each side with a jointed filament, while the last segment ends
  in a still longer, but unjointed process. These filaments are branchiae by means of which the
  Insect obtains air, being, as we have said, destitute of spiracles. It is an active creature and
  waves its filaments in a very graceful manner; this process no doubt aids the branchiae in their
  respiratory work. These larvae are well able to exist out of water if they have a sufficiently
  damp environment. They live on animal matter, but their life-history has not been followed in much
  detail and it is not known <span class="pagenum" id="page446"><span
  class="smaller">{446}</span></span>how many moults they make. The young larva has the head
  disproportionately large and the branchial filaments longer. When the growth is completed the
  larva returns to land, seeks a suitable situation in the soil, and after an interval changes to a
  pupa, in which the characters of the perfect Insect are plainly visible. Subsequently, without
  becoming again active, it changes to the perfect Insect, and enjoys, for a few days only, an
  aerial life.</p>

  <p>The anatomy of the larva has been treated by Dufour.<a id="NtA_370"
  href="#Nt_370"><sup>[370]</sup></a> The supra-oesophageal ganglion is remarkably small; nothing is
  said as to the existence of an infra-oesophageal ganglion; there are three thoracic and eight
  abdominal ganglia; the first pair of these latter are nearer together than the others, and this is
  also the case with the last three. The alimentary canal in the adult is provided with a large
  paunch attached to the crop by a narrow neck,<a id="NtA_371" href="#Nt_371"><sup>[371]</sup></a>
  but Dufour could find no trace of this in the larva. The structure of the branchiae has also been
  described by the indefatigable French entomotomist. A tracheal tube sends a branch into one of the
  appendages (Fig. 289); the branch gives off numerous smaller tracheae, which at their extremities
  break up into branchlets close to the integument. The tracheal tube that receives each main
  branchial trachea, sends off from near the point of entry of the latter another trachea, that
  distributes its branchlets on the alimentary canal. The margins of each appendage are set with
  swimming hairs, so that the branchiae act as organs of locomotion as well as of respiration, and
  by their activity in the former capacity increase the efficiency of their primary function.</p>

  <p>The genera <i>Corydalis</i> and <i>Chauliodes</i> form a group distinct from <i>Sialis</i>, and
  are totally different in appearance, being gigantic Insects, sometimes with the mandibles of the
  male enormously elongated (Fig. 290). The species of <i>Corydalis</i> are called in North America
  Hellgrammites;  Riley has described and figured the metamorphosis of <i>C. cornutus</i>,<a
  id="NtA_373" href="#Nt_373"><sup>[373]</sup></a> the life-history being very similar to that of
  our little <i>Sialis</i>. A mass consisting of two or three thousand eggs is formed by the female,
  and the young larva has long filaments at the sides of the body like <i>Sialis</i>.  These in the
  later larval life are comparatively shorter, but the Insect is then provided with another set of
  gills in the form of spongy masses on the under-side of the body.  Riley, however, considers that
  these organs serve the purpose of attachment rather than of respiration. The larvae are known to
  the Mississippi fishermen as crawlers, and are greatly esteemed as bait.</p>

  <p>The Raphidiides or snake-flies form the second tribe of Sialidae. There are only two genera,
  <i>Raphidia</i> and <i>Inocellia</i>, peculiar to the Palaearctic and Nearctic regions. The
  perfect Insects are chiefly remarkable for the elongation of the prothorax and back of the head to
  form a long neck, and for the existence in the female of an elongate exserted ovipositor. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page448"><span class="smaller">{448}</span></span>The species are rather
  numerous, and have been recently monographed by Albarda.<a id="NtA_374"
  href="#Nt_374"><sup>[374]</sup></a> The three or four British species of the genus are all rare
  Insects, and occur only in wooded regions.</p>

  <p>The Raphidiides, like the Sialides, have a carnivorous larva, which, however, is terrestrial in
  habits, feeding, it would appear, chiefly on Insects that harbour in old timber. The snake-fly
  larvae (Fig. 292) are very ingenious in their manner of escaping, which is done by an extremely
  rapid wriggling backwards. They are capable of undergoing very prolonged fasts, and then alter in
  form a good deal, becoming shorter and more shrivelled; Fig. 292 is taken from a specimen that had
  been fasting for several weeks. They are excessively voracious, and hunt after the fashion of
  beasts of prey; their habits have been described by Stein,<a id="NtA_375"
  href="#Nt_375"><sup>[375]</sup></a> who states that he kept a larva from August to the end of May
  of the following year without food; it then died in a shrivelled-up state. The larva of the
  snake-fly changes to a pupa that is remarkably intermediate in form between the perfect Insect and
  the larva; the eyes, legs, wing-pads, and ovipositor being but little different from those of the
  imago, while the general form is that of the larva, and the peculiar elongation of the neck of the
  imago is absent. This pupa differs from that of <i>Sialis</i> in the important particular that
  before undergoing its final ecdysis it regains its activity and is able to run about.</p>

  <p>The internal anatomy of <i>Raphidia</i> has been treated by Loew,<a id="NtA_376"
  href="#Nt_376"><sup>[376]</sup></a> and is of a very remarkable character; we can here only
  mention that the salivary glands consist of a pair of extremely elongate tubes, that there is a
  very definite paunch attached as an appendage to one side of the crop, and that the most peculiar
  character consists of the fact that, according to Loew, four of the six Malpighian tubes have not
  a free extremity, being attached <span class="pagenum" id="page449"><span
  class="smaller">{449}</span></span>at each end so as to form elongate loops; the mesenteron is
  very complex in character.</p>

  <p>A considerable number of fossil remains from both Tertiary and Mesozoic strata are referred to
  Sialidae; and a larval form from the red sandstone of Connecticut has been considered by Scudder
  to be a Sialid, and named <i>Mormolucoides articulatus</i>, but the correctness of this
  determination is very doubtful (Fig. 293). These fossils are, however, of special interest as
  being the most ancient Insect larvae yet brought to light. A still older fossil, from the
  Carboniferous strata of Illinois called <i>Miamia bronsoni</i>, is considered by Scudder to have
  several points of resemblance to Sialidae.</p>

  <p>The majority of the members of this family are very readily distinguished by the beak-like
  front of the head, this being chiefly due to enlargement of parts of the head itself, and in a
  less degree to prolongation of the mouth-parts. The upper (or front) face of the beak is formed
  entirely by the clypeus, the labrum being scarcely <span class="pagenum" id="page450"><span
  class="smaller">{450}</span></span>visible, though it may be detected at the sides of the tip of
  the beak; the sutures between the various parts of the head are nearly or quite obliterated, but
  it is probable that the sides of the beak are formed by the genae and by the stipites of the
  maxillae, and its under-surface chiefly by the submentum: the mentum itself is but small, the
  ligula is small, bifid at the extremity, and each branch bears a two-jointed palpus, the basal
  article being of very peculiar structure in <i>Panorpa</i>. The mandibles are but small, and are
  placed at the apex of the beak; they have each the form of an oblong plate armed with two very
  sharp teeth, and they cross freely. The maxillae are the only parts of the mouth-pieces that are
  very elongated; each cardo is articulated at the base of the head, and the stipes extends all the
  length of the side of the beak; each maxilla bears a five-jointed palpus and two small but very
  densely ciliated lobes. The antennae are long, very slender, and flexible, and are many-jointed;
  they are inserted between the eyes in large foramina; there are three ocelli, or none, and the
  compound eyes are moderately large. The prothorax is small, its notum is quite small or moderate
  in size, and the prothoracic stigma is placed behind it; the side-pieces are small, and there is
  no chitinous prosternum except a small longitudinal strip placed in the membrane between the
  coxae; these latter are of only moderate size, and are free and dependent. The meso- and
  meta-thorax are large, their side-pieces are of considerable dimensions and bear large, dependent
  coxae and supporting-pieces (Fig. 58); there is a stigma placed between the meso- and meta-thorax
  at the hind margin of the upper part of the meso-trochantin; both meso- and meta-notum are
  transversely divided. The abdomen is elongate, slender, conico-cylindrical, consisting of nine
  segments; the basal segment is membranous and concealed; the terminal appendages are of variable
  nature according to the species and sex. The legs are elongate and slender, the tarsi
  five-jointed. The internal anatomy of <i>Panorpa communis</i> has been examined by Dufour<a
  id="NtA_377" href="#Nt_377"><sup>[377]</sup></a> and Loew.<a id="NtA_378"
  href="#Nt_378"><sup>[378]</sup></a> They agree in describing the alimentary canal as being of
  peculiar structure: there is a short, slender oesophagus leading to an organ in which there is
  seated a remarkable arrangement of elongate hairs; this structure might be looked on as the
  proventriculus, but Loew considers it to be rather a <span class="pagenum" id="page451"><span
  class="smaller">{451}</span></span>division of the true stomach. The particulars given by these
  two anatomists as to some other parts of the internal anatomy are very discrepant.</p>

  <p>The Panorpidae form a small family of only nine or ten genera, two or three of these being
  exotic and only imperfectly known; the three genera found in Europe are composed of very curious
  Insects. The scorpion-flies&mdash;<i>Panorpa</i> proper&mdash;are very common Insects, and have
  received their vernacular name from the fact that the males have the terminal segments elongate
  and slender and very mobile, and carry them curved up somewhat after the fashion of the scorpions
  (Fig. 294). It is said that Aristotle was acquainted with these Insects, and considered them to be
  really winged scorpions.</p>

  <p>A second European genus, <i>Boreus</i>, is still more peculiar; it is destitute of wings, and
  has the appearance of a minute wingless grasshopper; it is found from late autumn to early spring
  in moss and under stones, and is said to be sometimes found disporting itself on the surface of
  the snow: the female of this Insect has an exserted ovipositor. The writer has found this little
  creature in Scotland among moss in November, and under stones early in March (Fig. 295). The third
  European genus, <i>Bittacus</i>, does not occur in our islands, but is common on many parts of the
  Continent; the perfect Insect has a great resemblance to a <i>Tipula</i>, or "daddy-long-legs"
  fly, and attaches itself to the stems of grasses, and preys on flies; according to Brauer it has
  the peculiar habit of using the hind pair of legs as hands (Fig. 296), instead of the front pair,
  as is usual in Insects. This remarkable genus is widely distributed, and species of it are found
  even in the Antipodes. A species inhabiting caves has been mentioned by M&lsquo;Lachlan.<a

  <p>The early stages of the Panorpidae were for long unknown, but have recently been discovered by
  Brauer: he obtained eggs of <i>Panorpa</i> by confining a number of the perfect flies in a vessel
  containing some damp earth on which was placed a piece of meat; when the young larvae were hatched
  they buried themselves in the earth and nourished themselves with the meat or its juices.</p>

  </div>

  <p>These larvae (Fig. 297) bear a great resemblance to those of the Hymenopterous family
  Tenthredinidae; they have biting mandibles and palp-bearing maxillae, and show no approach to the
  peculiar mouth structure found in the Hemerobiidae; there are three pairs of feet placed on the
  three thoracic segments, and there is also a pair of less perfect feet on each of the first eight
  abdominal segments, those behind being the larger. The upper surface of the body bears spines,
  which, however, disappear after the first change of skin, with the exception of the larger
  processes on the posterior segment, which persist throughout the life of the larva. The larvae are
  active for about one month; after this they become quiescent, but do not change to the pupa state
  for several weeks; when this happens they change in form and cannot creep, although their limbs
  are not enclosed in any pupa case. Brauer also discovered larvae of <i>Panorpa communis</i> at
  large in numbers in an old tree stump that was quite covered with moss, and contained many ants in
  the mouldering wood. The ants appeared to be on friendly terms with the <i>Panorpa</i> larvae. The
  earlier stages of <span class="pagenum" id="page453"><span
  class="smaller">{453}</span></span><i>Boreus</i> and <i>Bittacus</i> were also observed by Brauer;
  they are essentially similar to those of <i>Panorpa</i>, but the larva in <i>Boreus</i> is not
  provided with abdominal prolegs. The Panorpidae have been separated from the other Neuroptera by
  certain naturalists as a distinct Order, called Panorpatae by Brauer, Mecaptera by Packard; but in
  their structure as well as in their metamorphoses they are not so distinct from the Phryganeidae
  and the Hemerobiidae as to justify this step.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Fossil forms of <i>Bittacus</i> and of <i>Panorpa</i> have been found in amber and
  in the Tertiary strata, and Scudder has described some forms from Florissant in which there are no
  cross-veinlets in the wings. Some remains from the English Lias have been referred to Panorpidae
  by Westwood under the name <i>Orthophlebia</i>, but it is by no means certain that they really
  belong to the family.</p>

  <p>The Hemerobiidae are an extremely varied assemblage of Neuroptera; the perfect Insects of the
  various sub-families are very different in appearance, but the family as a whole is naturally
  defined by the very peculiar structure of the mouth-organs of the larvae. These Insects have, in
  fact, a suctorial <span class="pagenum" id="page454"><span
  class="smaller">{454}</span></span>mouth in their early life, and one of the ordinary biting type
  in adult life.</p>

  <p>This is a very unusual condition, being the reverse of what we find in Lepidoptera and some
  other of the large Orders, where the mouth is mandibulate in the young and suctorial in the adult.
  The suctorial condition is in Hemerobiidae chiefly due to modification of the mandibles; but this
  is never the case in the Insects that have a suctorial mouth in the imaginal instar. Nearly all
  the Hemerobiidae are terrestrial Insects in all their stages; a small number of them are, to a
  certain extent, amphibious in the larval life, while one or two genera possess truly aquatic
  larvae. The metamorphosis is, so far as the changes of external form are concerned, quite
  complete. There are no wingless forms in the adult stage.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The classification given by Hagen<a id="NtA_380"

  </div>

  <p>The ant-lions in their perfect state are usually unattractive Insects, and many are nocturnal
  in their habits; the species of the genus <i>Palpares</i> and allies (Fig. 299) are, however, of
  more handsome appearance, and attain a large expanse of wing. No member of the sub-family is an
  inhabitant of Britain, though species of the typical genus <i>Myrmeleon</i> are common in Central
  and Northern Europe. The <span class="pagenum" id="page455"><span
  class="smaller">{455}</span></span>remarkable habits of their larvae attracted the attention of
  naturalists so long ago as two hundred years. We owe to R&eacute;aumur an accurate and interesting
  account of <i>M. formicarius</i>, the species found in the neighbourhood of Paris. The larvae are
  predaceous, and secure their prey by means of pitfalls they excavate in the earth, and at the
  bottom of which they bury themselves, leaving only their elongate jaws projecting out of the sand
  at the bottom of the pit. They move only backwards, and in forming their pit use their broad body
  as a plough, and throw out the sand by placing it on the head and then sending it to a distance
  with a sudden jerk. When about to construct its trap the larva does not commence at the centre,
  but makes first a circular groove of the full circumference of the future pit. Burying its abdomen
  in the surface of the earth, the Insect collects on to its head, by means of the front leg, the
  sand from the side which is nearest to the centre, and then jerks the sand to a distance. By
  making a second circuit within the first one, and then another, the soil is gradually removed, and
  a conical pit is formed, at the bottom of which the ant-lion lurks, burying its body but leaving
  its formidable mandibles widely extended and projecting from the sand. In this position the young
  ant-lion waits patiently till some wandering Insect trespasses on its domains. An ant or fly
  coming over the edge of the pitfall finds the sand of the sloping sides yielding beneath its body,
  and in its effort to secure itself probably dislodges some more of the sand, which, descending to
  the bottom of the pit, brings the lurking lion into activity. Availing himself of his power of
  throwing sand with his head, the ant-lion jerks some in the neighbourhood of the trespasser, and
  continues to do so until the victim is brought to the bottom of the pit and into the very jaws of
  its destroyer; then there is no further hope of escape; the mandibles close, empale their prey,
  and do not relax their hold till the body of the victim is exhausted of its juices. The position
  chosen is in a place that will keep dry, as the larva cannot carry on its operations when the sand
  is wet or damp, hence the soil at the base of a high wall or a rock frequently harbours these
  Insects.</p>

      pallidipennis</i>. (After Meinert.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The parts of the mouth of the <i>Myrmeleon</i> are perfectly adapted for enabling it to empty
  the victim without for a moment relaxing its hold. There is no mouth-orifice of the usual
  character, and the contents of the victim are brought into the buccal cavity by means of a groove
  extending along the under side of each mandible; in this groove the elongate and slender lobe that
  replaces the maxilla&mdash;there being no maxillary palpi&mdash;plays backwards and forwards,
  probably raking or dragging backwards to the buccal cavity at each movement a small quantity of
  the contents of the empaled victim. The small lower lip is peculiar, consisting in greater part of
  the two lobes that support the labial palpi. The pharynx is provided with a complex set of
  muscles, and, together with the buccal cavity, functions as an instrument of suction. After the
  prey has been sucked dry the carcass is jerked away to a distance. When the ant-lion larva is full
  grown it forms a globular cocoon by fastening together grains of sand with fine silk from a
  slender spinneret placed at the posterior extremity of the body; in this cocoon it changes to an
  imago of very elongate form, and does not emerge until its metamorphosis is quite completed, the
  skin of the pupa being, when the Insect emerges, left behind in the cocoon. The names by which the
  European ant-lion has been known are very numerous. It was called Formicajo and Formicario by
  Vallisneri about two hundred years ago; R&eacute;aumur called it Formica-leo, and this was adopted by
  some modern authors as a generic name for some other of the ant-lions. The French people call
  these Insects Fourmilions, of which ant-lion is our English equivalent. The Latinised form of the
  term ant-lion, Formicaleo, is not now applied to the common ant-lion as a generic term, it having
  been proposed to replace it by <i>Myrmecoleon</i>, <i>Myrmeleo</i>, or <i>Myrmeleon</i>; this
  latter name at present seems likely to become generally adopted. There are several species of the
  genus found in Europe, and their trivial names have been confounded by various authors in such a
  way as to make it quite uncertain, without reference to a synonymic list, what species is intended
  by any particular writer. The species found in the neighbourhood of Paris, and to which it may be
  presumed R&eacute;aumur's history refers, is now called <span class="pagenum" id="page457"><span
  class="smaller">{457}</span></span><i>Myrmeleon formicarium</i> by Hagen and others;
  M&lsquo;Lachlan renamed it <i>M. europaeus</i>, but now considers it to be the <i>M. nostras</i>
  of Fourcroy. The popular name appears to be due to the fact that ants&mdash;Formica in Latin,
  Fourmi in French&mdash;form a large part of the victims; while lion&mdash;the other part of the
  name&mdash;is doubtless due to its prowess as a destroyer of animal life, though, as R&eacute;aumur long
  ago remarked, it is a mistake to apply the term lion to an Insect that captures its prey by
  strategy and by snares rather than by rapidity and strength. The imago of <i>Myrmeleon</i> is of
  shy disposition, and is rarely seen even in localities where the larva is abundant. It is of
  nocturnal habits, and is considered by Dufour to be carnivorous.</p>

  <p>Considerable difference of opinion has existed as to the structure of the mouth and of the
  alimentary canal in these larvae. R&eacute;aumur was of opinion that there exists no posterior orifice to
  the alimentary canal, but Dufour ridiculed this idea, and stated positively that such an orifice
  undoubtedly exists. It is also usually said that the mouth is closed by a membrane. Meinert has
  recently examined these points,<a id="NtA_381" href="#Nt_381"><sup>[381]</sup></a> and he states
  that the mouth is not closed by any membrane, but is merely compressed. He finds that there is no
  posterior exit from the stomach; that there is a compact mass without any cavity between the
  stomach and the point where the Malpighian tubes connect with the small intestine. The portions of
  aliment that are not assimilated by the larva collect in the stomach and are expelled as a mass,
  but only after the Insect has become an imago. This peculiar excrementitious mass consists
  externally of uric acid, and from its form and appearance has been mistaken for an egg by several
  naturalists. The posterior portions of the alimentary canal are, according to Meinert, of a
  remarkable nature. The small intestine is elongate, slender, and is coiled. There are eight very
  long and slender Malpighian tubes; a pair of these have free extremities, but the other six in the
  posterior part of their course are surrounded by a common membrane, and, following the course of
  the intestine, form ultimately a dilated body seated on a coecum. These six Malpighian tubes are
  considered to be partially, if not entirely, organs for the secretion of silk for forming the
  cocoon, the coecum being a reservoir. The canal terminates as a slender tube, which acts as a
  spinneret and is surrounded by a sheath. A complex set of muscles <span class="pagenum"
  id="page458"><span class="smaller">{458}</span></span>completes this remarkable spinning
  apparatus. The alimentary canal of the imago has been described and figured by Dufour<a
  id="NtA_382" href="#Nt_382"><sup>[382]</sup></a>; it is very different from that of the larva.</p>

  <p>The ant-lion is capable of sustaining prolonged fasts. Dufour kept specimens for six months
  without any food. These Insects are said to give off a peculiar ant-like odour, due, it is
  thought, to their ant-eating habits. Although no species inhabits Great Britain, yet one is found
  in Southern Sweden. Introduced specimens get on very well in confinement in our country,<a
  id="NtA_383" href="#Nt_383"><sup>[383]</sup></a> and would probably flourish at large for some
  years if they were liberated.</p>

  <p>Although the number of known species and genera of Myrmeleonides is considerable&mdash;that of
  the species being now upwards of 300&mdash;the members of the small genus <i>Myrmeleon</i> are the
  only forms that are known to make pits of the kind we have described. Other larvae<a id="NtA_384"
  href="#Nt_384"><sup>[384]</sup></a> are known similar in general form to the common ant-lion, but
  they walk forwards in the normal manner, and apparently hunt their prey by lurking in a hidden
  place and, when a chance occurs, rushing on the victim with rapidity. Brauer has observed this
  habit in the case of <i>Dendroleon pantherinus</i> in the Prater at Vienna.</p>

  <p>The sub-family Ascalaphides is not represented by any species in Britain, though <i>Ascalaphus
  longicornis</i> occurs as far north as Paris. In the mountainous regions of Central and Southern
  Europe some species of the group form a conspicuous part of the Insect fauna, owing to their bold
  and active flight; they are predaceous in their habits, and fly about in a hawking fashion
  somewhat like that of dragon-flies. Some of the larger of the numerous exotic species of the group
  are very like dragon-flies, but can be distinguished by a glance at the elongate antennae with a
  knob at the end. The sub-family consists of two groups&mdash;Holophthalmi and Schizophthalmi.
  M&lsquo;Lachlan says<a id="NtA_385" href="#Nt_385"><sup>[385]</sup></a>: "The eyes in the

  <p>When the weather is wet or cold the Ascalaphi repose on the stems of grass, with their wings
  placed in a roof-like manner, with the head downwards, and are then very successful in concealing
  themselves by the positions they assume, and by sidling round the stems to escape from enemies.
  Some information as to their metamorphosis has been obtained, though knowledge of this point is
  far from complete even as regards our European species of the typical genus <i>Ascalaphus</i>. For
  a long time it was supposed that a larva mentioned by Bonnet in his writings was that of
  <i>Ascalaphus</i>, but Brauer<a id="NtA_386" href="#Nt_386"><sup>[386]</sup></a> is of opinion
  that such is not the case, and as he has described the metamorphoses of <i>A. macaronius</i> he is
  no doubt correct. The eggs (Fig. 303, A), forty or fifty in number, are laid in two parallel rows
  on the stems of grass. The larvae (Fig. 304, larva of <i>Helicomitus</i> ?) are in general
  appearance somewhat like those of <i>Myrmeleon</i>; they are carnivorous in their habits, like the
  ant-lions, and have similar extraordinarily developed mandibles. Efforts to rear the young larvae
  failed, but they were kept alive for some time by supplying them with Aphidides found on
  <i>Centaurea jacea</i>. The cocoon is globular, and the change from the nymph state to the imago
  is made in the cocoon, the structure of the mandibles of the pupa being peculiar, and specially
  adapted to the purpose of opening the cocoon.<a id="NtA_387" href="#Nt_387"><sup>[387]</sup></a>
  The larvae of Ascalaphides, although so like the ant-lions in appearance, do not form pitfalls for
  the capture of their prey, but lurk under leaves on the ground, or under stones; they do not move
  backwards, but progress forwards in an ordinary manner; the habit of backward movement that we
  noticed in <i>Myrmeleon</i> being probably correlative with the habit of forming pitfalls. Hagen
  states<a id="NtA_388" href="#Nt_388"><sup>[388]</sup></a> that the larvae of Ascalaphides and
  Myrmeleonides, in addition to their peculiarities of form and mandibular structure, are
  distinguished from those of other Hemerobiidae by the hind legs having the tibia and tarsus united
  <span class="pagenum" id="page461"><span class="smaller">{461}</span></span>without articulation.
  Westwood<a id="NtA_389" href="#Nt_389"><sup>[389]</sup></a> has recently given an account of the
  young larvae of a Ceylonese Ascalaphid of doubtful species, but  possibly  <i>Helicomitus
  insimulans</i>; these were observed by Mr. Staniforth Green to have the very peculiar habit of
  sitting together in a long row on the stem of a plant, with the jaws widely extended and the body
  of each one covered by the head of the individual next it (Fig. 303, B). The little creatures
  waited patiently in this position until a fly walked between the mandibles of one of them, then
  these formidable weapons immediately closed, and did not relax their hold until the fly was sucked
  dry.  If Westwood is correct, the young larva of this species differs much from the adult one, the
  back of the head being broad and the setigerous processes of the body very much more developed.
  Nearly thirty genera of Ascalaphides are known.<a id="NtA_390" href="#Nt_390"><sup>[390]</sup></a>
  In the genus <i>Haplogenius</i> we find an exception to the usual rule that the wings in repose
  are held in a roof-like manner, it having been noticed by Bates that in the species in question
  the wings are held expanded as in the dragon-flies.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Nemopterides are a small group of delicate, graceful Insects. About thirty
  species are known. Knowledge of the group is still very imperfect. A larva has been found of a
  most remarkable nature that probably belongs to it; it was described under the name of
  <i>Necrophilus arenarius</i>, and considered to be a fully-developed Insect. This larva occurs in
  the tombs and pyramids of Egypt where sand has accumulated. The perfect Insects of the genus
  <i>Nemoptera</i> are, however, found in open places amongst bushes, and flit about in a very
  graceful manner. Several species are found in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean region <span
  class="pagenum" id="page463"><span class="smaller">{463}</span></span>(Fig. 305, <i>N.
  ledereri</i>), but none come so far north as Central Europe. Formerly the genus <i>Nemoptera</i>
  was considered to be allied to <i>Panorpa</i> on account of the beak-like front of the head. The
  parts of the mouth are, however, different from those of <i>Panorpa</i>, and it seems more
  probable that if the Nemopterides have to be merged in any of the divisions of Hemerobiidae, they
  will be placed in Chrysopides or Osmylides. The species of the sub-family were for a long time
  believed to be peculiar to the continental regions of the Old World, but a species has recently
  been discovered in Northern Chili.<a id="NtA_393" href="#Nt_393"><sup>[393]</sup></a></p>

  </div>

  <p>The members of this small group are readily recognised by the peculiar structure of the front
  legs; these organs resembling those of the Orthopterous family Mantidae, so that the earlier
  systematic entomologists, deceived by this resemblance, placed the Mantispides in the Order
  referred to.</p>

  <p>The Mantispides possess four membranous wings, either sub-equal in size or the posterior pair
  smaller than the front pair and not folded; the veins of these wings are rather numerous, as are
  also the cells they form; there is considerable difference amongst the species in this latter
  respect, owing to the transverse veinlets differing in their abundance. The antennae are short,
  not in the least thickened at the tip. The head is not produced into a beak. The anterior legs,
  placed quite at the front part of the thorax, have the coxae very long; the femur is somewhat
  incrassate, and is armed on one side with spines; the tibia is shaped and articulated so as to
  fold closely on to the spines, and to thus constitute a formidable and perfect prehensile organ,
  the tarsus being merely a small appendage.</p>

      Larva newly hatched, or first form; <b>B</b>, mature larva. (After Brauer.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Only a few species of <i>Mantispa</i> are found in Southern Europe; but the group has
  representatives in most of the warmer regions of the world, and will probably prove to be rather
  numerous in species. The front legs are used for the capture of prey in the same way as the
  somewhat similar front legs of the Mantidae. The transformations have been observed by Brauer<a
  id="NtA_394" href="#Nt_394"><sup>[394]</sup></a> in the case of one of the European species, <i>M.
  styriaca</i>. The eggs are numerous but very small, and are deposited in such a manner that each
  is borne by a long slender stalk, as in the lacewing flies. The larvae are hatched in autumn; they
  then hibernate and go for about seven months before they take any food. In the spring, when the
  spiders of the genus <i>Lycosa</i> have formed their bags of eggs, the minute <i>Mantispa</i>
  larvae (Fig. 308, A) find them out, tear a hole in the bag, and enter among the eggs; here they
  wait until the eggs have attained a fitting stage of development before they commence to feed.
  Brauer found that they ate the spiders when these were quite young, and then changed their skin
  for the second time, the first moult having taken place when they were hatched from the egg. At
  this second moult the larva undergoes a considerable change of form; it becomes unfit for
  locomotion, and the head loses the comparatively large size and high development it previously
  possessed. The <i>Mantispa</i> larva&mdash;only one of which flourishes in one egg-bag of a
  spider&mdash;undergoes this change in the midst of a mass of dead young spiders it has gathered
  together in a peculiar manner. It undergoes no further change of skin, and is full fed in a few
  days; after which it spins a cocoon in the interior of the egg-bag of the spider, and changes to a
  nymph inside its larva-skin. <span class="pagenum" id="page465"><span
  class="smaller">{465}</span></span>Finally the nymph breaks through the barriers&mdash;larva-skin,
  cocoon, and egg-bag of the spider&mdash;by which it is enclosed, and after creeping about for a
  little, appears in its final form as a perfect <i>Mantispa</i>. Thus in this Insect
  hypermetamorphosis occurs; the larval life consisting of two different instars, one of which is
  specially adapted for obtaining access to the creature it is to prey on. It should be noticed that
  though this Insect is so destructive to the young spiders, the mother spider shows no hostility to
  it, but allows the destroying larva to enter her bag of eggs without any opposition; she appears,
  indeed, to be so unconscious of the havoc that is going on amongst her young that in one case she
  continued to watch over and protect the egg-bag in which the destruction was taking place during
  the whole of the period of the larval development and half the period of pupation of the
  <i>Mantispa</i>.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The larval history of a second species of the Mantispides, <i>Symphrasis varia</i>,
  is partially known;<a id="NtA_395" href="#Nt_395"><sup>[395]</sup></a> this Insect lives
  parasitically in the nests of a South American wasp, and each larva when full fed spins a cocoon
  in one of the cells of the Hymenopteron.</p>

    over the body; the antennae moniliform or pectinate, not clavate.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>The Hemerobiides consist of several minor groups about whose number and characters systematists
  are not very well agreed, and about some of which very little is known. We merely mention the
  latter, giving details as to some of the better known only.</p>

  <p>1. The Dilarina are a small group found chiefly in the Old World, where, however, they have a
  wide distribution. North and South America have each one species. They are distinguished by their
  antennae, which, in the male, are pectinate somewhat like those of many Lepidoptera, this
  character being of extremely rare occurrence in the Neuroptera; the abdomen of the female
  terminates in a long ovipositor.  The metamorphoses are not known.</p>

  <p>2. Nymphidina: Australian Insects resembling Myrmeleonides, but having antennae without club.
  Metamorphoses not known.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page466"><span class="smaller">{466}</span></span></div>

  <p>3. Osmylina: a group of delicate and elegant Insects of small or moderate size, distinguished
  by the possession of three simple eyes placed on the middle of the head just above the antennae. A
  species of this group, <i>Osmylus chrysops</i> (<i>maculatus</i> of some authors), is an
  inhabitant of Britain (Fig. 212); its larva is to some extent amphibious. The metamorphoses have
  been observed by Dufour, Brauer, and Hagen;<a id="NtA_396" href="#Nt_396"><sup>[396]</sup></a> it
  lurks under stones in or close to the water, or in moss, or on the stems of aquatic plants, and
  pierces and empties small Insects with its sucking-spears, which are very elongate. The young are
  hatched from the egg in the autumn and hibernate before becoming full grown; when this moment
  arrives the larva spins a round cocoon of silk mixed with sand. The pupa, or nymph, in general
  appearance somewhat resembles the perfect Insect, except that it is shorter and has the short
  wing-pads clinging close to the body. Dufour denied the existence of abdominal spiracles in either
  larva or imago, but, according to Hagen, they are certainly present in both. It would appear that
  in the larva the alimentary canal is not open beyond the chylific ventricle, and that its terminal
  section is modified to form a spinning apparatus.</p>

  <p><i>Osmylus</i> and its allies, including <i>Sisyra</i>, are now frequently treated as a
  separate sub-family, Osmylides, equivalent to the Chrysopides. In it is placed a very anomalous
  Insect&mdash;<i>Psectra dispar</i>&mdash;of great rarity. The male has only two wings, the
  posterior pair being the merest rudiments, though the female has the four wings normally
  developed. Individuals of the male have been found<a id="NtA_397"

  region&mdash;Somersetshire being one of them&mdash;and also in North America.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page467"><span class="smaller">{467}</span></span></div>

  <p>The genus <i>Sisyra</i> forms for some Neuropterists the type of a separate group called
  Sisyrina, though by others it is placed, as we have said, with the Osmylina, though it is
  destitute of ocelli. The larvae of at least one species of this genus are aquatic, and have been
  found in abundance living in <i>Spongilla</i> (<i>Ephydatia</i>) <i>fluviatilis</i>, a fresh-water
  sponge; when discovered their nature was not at first recognised, as they possess on each ventral
  segment a pair of articulated appendages, looking like legs, but which are considered to be more
  of the nature of gills. The sucking-spears of this Insect are so long and slender as to look like
  hairs; whether the little animal draws its nutriment from the sponge, or merely uses this latter
  as a place of shelter, is not ascertained.</p>

  veinlets are especially numerous at the margins, owing to the mode of forking of the nervures
  there (Fig. 298, <i>Drepanepteryx phalaenoides</i>). The larvae of most of the species of which
  the habits are known <span class="pagenum" id="page468"><span
  class="smaller">{468}</span></span>live on Aphides, which they suck dry, and at least one species,
  in all probability several, has the habit of covering itself with the skins of the victims it has
  sucked; to these remains it adds other small debris, and the whole mass completely covers and
  conceals the Insect (Fig. 311, B). The larva is furnished at the sides with projections which
  serve as pedicels to elongate divergent hairs, and these help to keep the mass in place on the
  back of the Insect; some fine threads are distributed through this curious mantle and serve to
  keep it from disintegration, but whether they are fragments of spiders' webs or are spun by the
  Insect itself is not quite clear.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The genus <i>Drepanepteryx</i> consists of several species, and appears to be best

  like several of its congeners, a moth-like appearance, and it has a peculiar structure for
  bringing the hind and fore wings into correlation, the costa at the base of the hind wing being
  interrupted and prominent, furnished with setae (Fig. 312, A), and playing in a cavity on the
  under-surface of the front wing. This character is of great interest in connexion with analogous
  structures of a more perfect nature existing in various moths. M&lsquo;Lachlan has described and
  figured<a id="NtA_398" href="#Nt_398"><sup>[398]</sup></a> a more primitive, though analogous,
  condition of the wings in <i>Megalomus hirtus</i>, also a species of British Hemerobiina. Another
  very curious feature of <i>D. phalaenoides</i> is shown in Fig. 312, B, there being a narrow space
  on the hind part of the front wing from which the colour is absent, while the nervures appear to
  be interrupted; they are, however, really present, though transparent; the nature of this peculiar
  mark is quite unknown, but is of considerable interest in connexion with the small transparent
  spaces that exist on the wings of some butterflies.</p>

  <p>The lacewing-flies&mdash;also called stink-flies and golden-eyes&mdash;are excessively delicate
  Insects, of which we possess about 15 species in Britain. Their antennae are more slender and less
  distinctly jointed than they are in Hemerobiides, and the Chrysopides are more elongate Insects.
  The peculiar metallic colour of their eyes is frequently very conspicuous, the eyes looking,
  indeed, as if they were composed of shining metal; this fades very much after death. Although not
  very frequently noticed, the Chrysopides are really common Insects, and are of considerable
  importance owing to their keeping "greenfly" in check.</p>

  <p>The eggs are very remarkable objects (Fig. 314), each one being supported at the top of a stalk
  many times as long as itself; in some species (<i>C. aspersa</i>) the eggs are laid in groups,
  those of each group being supported on a common stalk. The larvae (Fig. 315) are of a very
  voracious disposition, and destroy large quantities of plant-lice by piercing them with
  sucking-spears, the bodies of the victims being afterwards quickly exhausted of their contents by
  the action of the apparatus connected with the spears. The larvae of two or three species of
  <i>Chrysopa</i> cover themselves with the skins of their victims after the manner of the larvae of
  <i>Hemerobius</i>; but most of the larvae of <i>Chrysopa</i> are unclothed, and hunt their victims
  after the fashion of the larvae of Coccinellidae, to which these <i>Chrysopa</i> larvae bear a
  considerable general resemblance. These larvae have a remarkable structure at the extremity of
  their feet, but its use is quite unknown (Fig. 315, B, C). Some larvae of the genus make use of
  various substances as a means of disguise or protection. Dewitz noticed<a id="NtA_399"
  href="#Nt_399"><sup>[399]</sup></a> that some specimens he denuded of their clothing and placed in
  a glass, seized small pieces of paper with their mandibles and, bending the head, placed the
  morsels on their backs; here the pieces remained in consequence of the existence of hooked hairs
  on the skin. Green algae or cryptogams are much used for clothing, and Dewitz supposes that the
  Insect spins them together with webs to facilitate their retention. According to Constant and
  Lucas<a id="NtA_400" href="#Nt_400"><sup>[400]</sup></a> the larvae of <i>Chrysopa</i> attack and
  kill the larvae <span class="pagenum" id="page471"><span class="smaller">{471}</span></span>of
  Lepidoptera and Phytophagous Hymenoptera. The curious form we figure (Fig. 316) has been hatched
  from eggs found by Brauer on <i>Pinus abies</i> in Austria. The eggs were of the stalked kind we
  have described; the young escaped from them in the autumn, twelve days after deposition, but did
  not take any food till the following spring.</p>

  <p>These little Insects are the smallest of the Order Neuroptera, and have the appearance of
  winged Coccidae; their claim to be considered members of the Neuroptera was formerly doubted, but
  their natural history is quite concordant with that of the Hemerobiid groups, near which they are
  now always placed. L&ouml;w has made us acquainted with the habits and structure of an Austrian
  species, <i>Coniopteryx lutea</i> Wallg., but for which he has proposed the new generic name
  <i>Aleuropteryx</i>; the larvae are found on <i>Pinus mughus</i> at Vienna feeding on
  <i>Aspidiotus abietis</i>, which they pierce with sucking-spears, after the fashion of the
  Hemerobiides; when full fed they spin a cocoon formed of a double layer of silk, in which
  metamorphosis takes place in a manner similar to that of other Hemerobiidae. The better-known
  genus <i>Coniopteryx</i> differs from <i>Aleuropteryx</i> in having the sucking-spears short and
  nearly concealed by the front of the head, which is somewhat prolonged.</p>

  <p>The caddis-flies are Insects of moth-like appearance, found in the neighbourhood of water;
  their larvae live in this element, where they may sometimes be found in abundance. Phryganeidae
  are not very attractive Insects, and there are few of large size; Hence they have been much
  neglected by entomologists, and very little is known about the exotic forms of the family. The
  habitations constructed by the larvae are, many of them, of a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page474"><span class="smaller">{474}</span></span>curious nature, and usually attract more
  attention than do the creatures they serve to protect.</p>

  <p>The Phryganeidae form the division or series Trichoptera; the two terms are therefore
  synonymous; those entomologists who consider these Insects to form a distinct Order use the latter
  appellation for it.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The perfect Insect, though the wings are usually ample, has but feeble powers of flight, and
  rarely ventures far from the water it was reared in; it has a moth-like appearance, and the wings
  in repose meet, at an angle, in a roof-like manner over the back (Fig. 326, E). The head is small,
  with the front inflexed; it has two large compound eyes, and usually three ocelli; the antennae
  are slender, thread-like, and occasionally attain a great length. The parts of the mouth are very
  peculiar, the labrum and the palpi&mdash;especially the maxillary palps&mdash;being well
  developed, while the lobes of the maxillae and labium are amalgamated and therefore indistinct.
  The labrum is more or less elongate, and is more mobile than is usual in mandibulate Insects; it
  is held closely applied to the maxillae. These latter are small, have usually only a single small
  free lobe; they are united to one another and to the labium by membrane in such a manner as to
  form a channel along the middle of the mouth, the labrum forming the roof of this channel. The
  palpi are in some cases (Sericostomatides) of a remarkable nature; their joints vary in number
  from three to five, and differ sometimes in the sexes of the same species. The lower lip appears
  as a plate supporting the labial palpi, which are three-jointed and do not exhibit any
  peculiarities of structure comparable with those we have mentioned as so frequently existing in
  the maxillary palps. Difference of opinion exists as to the mandibles, some entomologists
  declaring them to be entirely absent, while others state that a small tubercular process that may
  be seen in some species on each side of the labrum is their representative. The prothorax is very
  small, the notum is the largest piece but is quite short, the side-pieces are very small, and the
  sternum appears to consist only of membrane. The mesothorax is much the largest segment of the
  body; its sternum <span class="pagenum" id="page475"><span class="smaller">{475}</span></span>is
  large, but is nearly perpendicular in direction, and is much concealed by the elongate, free front
  coxae, which repose against it. The metathorax is intermediate in size between the pro- and
  meso-thorax; its side-pieces are rather large, but the sternum is membranous, with a heart-shaped
  piece of more chitinous consistence in the middle, entirely covered by the middle coxae. The
  side-pieces both of the meso- and meta-thorax are large, and are closely connected; the middle and
  posterior coxae are very large, elongate, and prominent, and the middle pair slope backwards, so
  that their tips are in contact with the tips of the hind pair. The abdomen is cylindric and rather
  slender; it looks as if formed of eight segments in addition to the terminal segment; this latter
  in the male usually bears remarkably modified appendages. The first ventral plate is sometimes, if
  not always, entirely membranous; indeed the texture of the segments is in general very delicate,
  so that they shrivel up to an extent that renders their comprehension from dried specimens very
  difficult. The legs are always elongate, the coxae attaining in some forms a remarkable length,
  and the tibiae and tarsi are armed with many spines; the tarsi are five-jointed, slender,
  frequently very elongate, terminated by two large claws and an apparatus, placed between them,
  consisting of a pair of hair-like processes with a membranous lobe.</p>

  <p>The structure of the mouth-parts of the Phryganeidae has given rise to much difference of
  interpretation; it has recently been investigated by R. Lucas<a id="NtA_401"
  href="#Nt_401"><sup>[401]</sup></a> in connexion with <i>Anabolia furcata</i> (Fig. 321). He
  agrees with other observers that mandibles are present in the pupa, but states that no rudiment of
  them exists in the imago. He calls the peculiar structure formed by the combination of the
  maxillae and <span class="pagenum" id="page476"><span class="smaller">{476}</span></span>labium a
  haustellum. He looks on the Trichoptera as possessing a mouth intermediate between the biting and
  sucking types of Insect-mouths. He considers that the Phryganeidae take food of a solid, as well
  as of a liquid, nature by means of the haustellum, but the solid matter must be in the form of
  small particles, and then is probably sucked up by the help of saliva added to it. Lucas says also
  that in the larvae certain parts of the salivary glands serve the function of spinning organs, and
  it is from these that the salivary glands of the imago are formed; those salivary glands of the
  larva that are not spinning glands disappearing entirely.</p>

  <p>The eggs are deposited in a singular manner; they are extruded in a mass surrounded by jelly;
  there may be as many as one hundred eggs in such a mass. This is sometimes carried about by the
  female after its extrusion from the interior of the body, but is finally confided to a suitable
  place in stream, spring, or pool. It is said that the female occasionally descends into the water
  to affix the egg-mass to some object therein, but this requires confirmation, and it is more
  probable that the egg-mass is merely dropped in a suitable situation. As soon as the larvae are
  hatched they begin to provide themselves with cases; they select small pieces of such material as
  may be at hand in the water, and connect them together by means of silk spun from the mouth.
  Particulars as to these tubes we will defer till we have considered the larvae themselves. These
  have the general appearance of caterpillars of moths; in order to move about they must put their
  head and the three pairs of legs at the front of the body out of their tube or case, and they then
  look very like case-bearing caterpillars. The part of the body that usually remains under cover is
  different in texture and colour, and frequently bears outstanding processes, or filaments,
  containing tracheae for the purpose of extracting air from the water. Some peculiar spaces of a
  <span class="pagenum" id="page477"><span class="smaller">{477}</span></span>different texture may
  be seen on certain larvae (Fig. 322, B); these may possibly be also connected with respiration. On
  each side of the extremity of the body there is a rather large hook by which the creature attaches
  its dwelling to its body, and there are also frequently present three large bosses on the anterior
  abdominal segment, which are supposed to assist towards the same end. The hold it thus obtains is
  so firm that it cannot be dragged out by pulling from the front; fishermen have, however,
  discovered a way of extracting it by a strategic operation: the cases are, as a rule, partially
  open behind, and by putting a blunt object in and annoying the larva it is induced to relax the
  hold of its hooks and advance forwards in the case, or even to leave it altogether. The firm hold
  of the larva is maintained in spite of the fact that the body does not fill the case. It is
  necessary that water should pass freely into and out of the case, and that there should be some
  space for the respiratory filaments to move in. The mouth of the case is open, and the posterior
  extremity is arranged by the larva in such manner as to allow a passage for the water; various
  ingenious devices are adopted by different species of larvae with the object of protecting the
  hind end of the body, and at the same time of permitting water to pass through the case.</p>

  <p>The mode of changing the skin, or the frequency with which this occurs in the larval state of
  the caddis flies has not been recorded. The duration of life in this stage is usually
  considerable, extending over several months: indeed in our climate many species pass the winter in
  this stage, completing the metamorphosis in the following spring or summer; and as one generation
  each year appears to be the rule, it may be assumed that the larval condition in such cases lasts
  from seven to ten months. During this stage the Insects are chiefly vegetable feeders, some being
  said to feed on minute algae; animal diet is not, however, entirely avoided, and it is said by
  Pictet that not only do some of the Phryganeidae eat other Insects, but that they also sometimes
  devour their companions.</p>

  <p>At the end of the larval period of existence the creature closes its case by a light web spun
  at each end, taking care not to prevent the ingress and egress of the water; it sometimes adds a
  stone or piece of stick, and having thus protected itself, changes to a nymph. During the first
  part of this metamorphosis the creature is completely helpless, for there is so great a difference
  between the external structures of the larva and nymph as to make the latter a new being, so far
  as these organs are concerned. The changes take place in the interior of the larval skin, and as
  they are completed this latter is shed piecemeal. The resulting pupa or nymph greatly resembles
  the perfect Insect, differing consequently very much from the larva. Pictet, who paid special
  attention to the nymph condition of these Insects, concludes, however, that many of the organs of
  the nymph are actually formed within the corresponding parts of the larva, and has given a figure
  that, if trustworthy, shows that the legs of the nymph, notwithstanding the great difference
  between them as they exist in the larva and in the perfect Insect, are actually formed within the
  legs of the larva; each nymphal leg being rolled up in the skin of the corresponding larval leg,
  in a spiral, compressed manner, and the only articulations that can be detected in the leg being
  those of the tarsus. The head of the nymph is armed in front with two curious projections that
  are, in fact, enormously developed mandibles (Fig. 323, B); they serve as cutting implements to
  enable the nymph to effect its escape from its prison; they are cast off with the nymph-skin, the
  perfect Insect being thus destitute of these organs. The abdomen of the nymph differs from that of
  the perfect Insect in possessing external respiratory filaments; the nymphs of some species have
  also the middle legs provided with swimming-hairs, that do not exist in the imago.</p>

  <p>As a rule the larvae bring the respiratory filaments into contact with the water by moving the
  abdomen, but Fritz M&uuml;ller found<a id="NtA_402" href="#Nt_402"><sup>[402]</sup></a> that those of a
  <i>Macronema</i> move the gills themselves&mdash;after the manner of Ephemeridae&mdash;with much
  rapidity. Many kinds of larvae of Phryganeids possess at the posterior extremity of the body
  exsertile pouches in the form of finger-like, or even branched, processes into which tracheae do
  not enter. M&uuml;ller observed that in the <i>Macronema</i> alluded to these pouches were generally
  not <span class="pagenum" id="page479"><span class="smaller">{479}</span></span>exserted; when,
  however, the larva ceased to move the tracheal gills, then these pouches were protruded. He is
  inclined to consider them blood-gills. Similar structures are found in <i>Eristalis</i> and some
  other Dipterous larvae that have to breathe under difficulties.</p>

  <p>The imagines of certain species possess filaments&mdash;or something of the sort&mdash;on the
  abdomen. Palm&eacute;n, who has examined these organs in <i>Hydropsyche</i>, thinks that they are the
  remains of gills that existed in the larva and pupa, and that they are functionless in the
  imaginal instar. M&lsquo;Lachlan thinks that in <i>Diplectrona</i>, where the filaments are
  elongate, they may be functionally active even in the imago.<a id="NtA_403"
  href="#Nt_403"><sup>[403]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The skin of the nymph is at first very soft, but it soon hardens, and when about fifteen or
  twenty days have elapsed the nymph opens its case by means of the mandibular processes, and swims
  through the water with its back downwards till it reaches some solid object by which it can ascend
  to the air; the nymph skin then swells and splits, and the thorax of the imago protrudes; this is
  soon followed by the disengagement of the head and other parts, and the imago having thus escaped,
  the nymph skin remains a complete model of the external structure of the nymph, and contains a
  considerable number of tracheae. This sketch of the metamorphosis of a caddis-fly does not apply
  in all its details to all the forms of caddis-flies, there being exceptions, as we shall mention
  hereafter.</p>

  <p>Dewitz has described<a id="NtA_404" href="#Nt_404"><sup>[404]</sup></a> the first appearance
  and development of the wings in larvae of Phryganeidae. Each one appears at first in the form of a
  small thickening of the hypodermis, accompanied outwardly by a minute depression of the chitin
  (Fig. 324, A). He compares the structure in the earliest stage to the entothoracic projections
  into the interior of the body. The rudiment grows as the larva increases in size, the chitinous
  portion being duly shed at the ecdyses. When the rudiment is larger and more complex, a mesoderm
  layer appears in it (Fig. 324, B); this is derived from a nerve-sheath near the rudiment. During
  the resting state of the larva&mdash;after its case has been closed, but before the pupal form has
  appeared&mdash;the wing assumes the form and position shown in C, Fig. 324. Dewitz's description
  of the process leaves much to be desired, and it is doubtful whether in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page480"><span class="smaller">{480}</span></span>C the position of the wing on the exterior
  of the body is due to the stripping off of the chitinous integument, or to a process of eversion,
  or to both.</p>

  geographical <span class="pagenum" id="page481"><span
  class="smaller">{481}</span></span>distribution is, however, by no means peculiar to them, for a
  similar discontinuity of distribution exists in numerous other groups of Insects, and even in
  other divisions of the Phryganeidae.</p>

  <p>The Phryganeides almost without exception inhabit still waters, and it is more specially to
  them that the brief sketch of metamorphosis given in the preceding pages will be found to apply.
  The larva always has the respiratory filaments simple and thread-like, though elongate, and lives
  in a case that it carries about; this case is open at both ends, and the larva is said to
  occasionally cut off the end having the least diameter and increase the other end, thus
  accommodating the habitation to its own growth.</p>

  <p><b>Limnophilides.</b>&mdash;These Insects have only three, instead of four, joints in the
  maxillary palpi, but in most other respects agree with the Phryganeides. There is, however,
  greater variety in the habits of the larvae, though all live in free cases. In the genus
  <i>Enoicyla</i> (Fig. 326) we meet with the anomaly of a Trichopterous Insect that lives amongst
  moss and dead leaves, far away, it may be, from water. The cases of the Limnophilides are
  constructed of a great variety of materials, and are often decorated with shells containing living
  inmates.</p>

  <p>In the genus <i>Apatania</i> the phenomenon of parthenogenesis is thought to occur, there being
  at least two species in which no male specimen has ever been discovered, though M&lsquo;Lachlan
  has made special efforts to discover the sex of <i>A. muliebris</i>. It should, however, be stated
  that these species have not been extensively investigated; <i>A. arctica</i> has been detected in
  the Arctic regions, and <i>A. muliebris</i> has occurred in several localities in Europe, in
  Britain chiefly near Arundel in a lake of intensely cold water.</p>

  <p><b>Sericostomatides</b>, like the Limnophilides, is a group rich in species; the larvae are
  chiefly found in streams.  They form portable cases out of sand and stones (Fig. 325, B, case of
  <i>Crunoecia irrorata</i>) in preference to vegetable matter. It is here that the genus
  <i>Helicopsyche</i>, which for long was an enigma to naturalists, is now placed. This genus
  consists of Insects whose larvae form spiral cases, similar to small snail shells, of sand or
  minute stones. These objects occur in various parts of the world. Fritz M&uuml;ller<a id="NtA_406"
  href="#Nt_406"><sup>[406]</sup></a> has informed us that the larva inhabiting one of them, when it
  withdraws entirely within its abode to repose, takes the precaution of anchoring its snail-like
  habitation, fixing it to a rock or stone by spinning some temporary silken threads. The
  respiratory filaments in this group are filiform.</p>

  <p><b>Leptocerides.</b>&mdash;The first group of the division Aequipalpia; so that there are
  five-jointed maxillary palpi in both sexes; these organs are frequently developed in a remarkable
  manner. The antennae are usually extremely long and slender. The case of the larva is portable
  (Fig. 325, A, case of <i>Odontocerum</i>); the respiratory filaments are not very conspicuous;
  they form short tufts placed on various parts of the abdomen. M&uuml;ller<a
  href="#Nt_406"><sup>[406]</sup></a> has called attention to a species whose larva lives in Brazil
  between the leaves of Bromeliae on trees.</p>

  <p>The <b>Oestropsides</b> is a small group, and has recently been reduced by M&lsquo;Lachlan to
  the rank of an inferior division.</p>

  <p><b>Hydropsychides.</b>&mdash;An extensive group, in which the larvae are believed to be chiefly
  of carnivorous habits. They vary, according to species, as to the nature of the respiratory
  filaments, and live in fixed abodes; these are less tubular than is the rule with the portable
  cases, and are formed from pieces of sand and stone spun together and fixed to larger stones under
  water. Sometimes several larvae live together in loosely compacted structures of this kind, and
  only form true cases when about to undergo their metamorphosis. M&uuml;ller describes<a
  href="#Nt_406"><sup>[406]</sup></a> a Brazilian species of <i>Rhyacophylax</i> as forming a case
  in which the mouth-end has a <span class="pagenum" id="page483"><span
  class="smaller">{483}</span></span>large funnel-shaped verandah, covered by a beautiful silken
  net. This larva lives in the rapids of various rivulets, and the entrance to the verandah is
  invariably directed towards the upper part of the rivulet, so as to intercept any edible material
  brought down by the water. Several of these larvae, moreover, build their cases so that they form
  a transverse row on the upper side of a stone; as many as thirty cases may be placed in one of
  these rows, and sometimes several rows are placed parallel with one another. This same larva has
  the habit of coming out of its case when necessary, and suspending itself in the water&mdash;as
  some caterpillars do in the air&mdash;by means of a silken thread. Other members of the
  Hydropsychides form tubes or covered ways of silk, earth and mud attached to stones, and in which
  they can move freely about. Some of the Hydropsychidae have been ascertained with certainty to be
  carnivorous in the larval state. A species of the genus <i>Hydropsyche</i> has been found by
  Howard<a id="NtA_407" href="#Nt_407"><sup>[407]</sup></a> to help itself in the task of procuring
  food by spreading a net in the water in connexion with the mouth of its case. This net is woven in
  wide meshes with extremely strong silk, and supported at the sides and top by bits of twigs and
  small portions of the stems of water-plants. Small larvae brought down by the current are arrested
  by this net for the advantage of the larva that lurks in the tube. The breathing organs of the
  larvae of Hydropsychides are apparently of a varied character, and would well repay a careful
  study. Mr. Morton informs the writer that some of our British species of <i>Philopotamus</i> and
  <i>Tinodes</i> have no gills either in the larval or pupal state, and probably respire by means of
  modified tracts in the integument. In some of the allied genera, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Polycentropus</i>,
  the larvae are destitute of gills, but the pupae possess them.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <b>Rhyacophilides</b> is another group in which the larval habitations are fixed. Some of
  these larvae have no respiratory filaments, breathing only by means of the stigmata, but others
  have tufts of filaments. These Insects have a peculiarity in their <span class="pagenum"
  id="page484"><span class="smaller">{484}</span></span>metamorphosis inasmuch as the larva, instead
  of lying free, constructs a cocoon in its case or other habitation in which to change to a nymph.
  In the larvae that do not make use of a portable case the abdominal hooks are not essential, and
  are replaced by other organs differing much in structure, being sometimes apparently of a
  sensitive nature, in other forms possibly respiratory. M&uuml;ller tells us of a carnivorous larva of
  this group in which the anterior legs are armed with powerful forceps for predatory purposes.</p>

  <p>The <b>Hydroptilides</b> comprise the most minute of the Phryganeidae, and their species will
  probably prove to be very numerous in well-watered tropical regions, though few have yet been
  described from there. The perfect Insects (Fig. 320) bear an extreme resemblance to small moths of
  the group Tineidae. The larvae (Fig. 329) are destitute of respiratory filaments, and construct
  portable cases of a variety of forms, some resembling seeds. M&uuml;ller has given particulars of a
  curious nature as to the cases of some Brazilian Hydroptilides; one species moors its dwelling to
  a stone by means of a long silken cable, by this artifice combining safety with the power of
  ranging over a considerable extent of water. In <i>Diaulus</i> there is only a narrow slit at each
  end of the case, but one side of it is provided with two chimneys to permit the flow of water for
  respiratory purposes.</p>

  <p>The larva of <i>Oxyethira</i> (Fig. 330) is a curious form, possessing comparatively long legs,
  and a head and thorax slender in comparison with the distended hind body. The cases are fastened,
  for the purposes of pupation, to a leaf of a water-lily.</p>

  <p>Some very curious anomalies as regards the development of the wings exist in the Phryganeidae;
  <i>Anomalopteryx</i>, for instance, has the wings quite short and useless for flight in the male,
  while in the other sex they are ample; in <i>Enoicyla</i>&mdash;the curious Insect figured on p.
  481, in which the larvae are of terrestrial habits&mdash;we find the females with only rudiments
  <span class="pagenum" id="page485"><span class="smaller">{485}</span></span>of wings, while in
  <i>Thamastes</i> the posterior wings are absent in both sexes.  These anomalies are at present
  quite inexplicable; and we may here mention that we are in complete ignorance as to the functional
  importance of many of the peculiarities of the Phryganeidae. We do not know why the mouth is
  reduced from the normal state, the maxillary palpi being, on the other hand, extraordinarily
  developed; we do not know the importance of the numerous spines and of the spurs on the legs, nor
  of the hairs on the wings, although these are amongst the most characteristic of the special
  features of this group of Insects.</p>

  <p><b>Fossils.</b>&mdash;Abundant remains of Phryganeidae belonging to the Tertiary epoch have
  been discovered. They are common in amber, and it is a remarkable fact that a larval case has been
  found in amber. This seems almost inexplicable, except on the assumption that such larvae were of
  arboreal habits, a condition that, at the present time, must be excessively rare, though the
  terrestrial habits of <i>Enoicyla</i> warrant us in believing it may occur. In the Tertiary Lake
  Basin at Colorado the remains of Phryganeidae in the imago state are extremely abundant, so that
  it is curious that but few such remains have been found in Europe. In Auvergne the so-called
  indusial limestone, which is two or three yards thick over a wide area, is considered to be
  composed chiefly of the cases of larvae of this family.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In the Mesozoic epoch some wings found in the lower Purbeck strata are considered
  to be those of Phryganeidae; similar wings have been found in the Lias, but this is the only
  evidence of the existence of the family at that period except a tube, supposed to be a larval
  case, detected in the Cretaceous of Bohemia. Earlier than this nothing has been discovered that
  can be connected with the family, so that at present the palaeontological evidence appears
  unfavourable to the view held by some that the Phryganeidae may be considered forms allied to the
  early <span class="pagenum" id="page486"><span class="smaller">{486}</span></span>conditions of
  the Lepidoptera. It should be noted that the head in Phryganeidae is the most important part from
  a systematic point of view, and that fossils have been chiefly identified from the wings; this is
  a much more doubtful character, as the wings of the Phryganeidae have a simple system of
  neuration, and in shape have nothing very characteristic.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Extinct Order Palaeodictyoptera.</b></p>

  <p class="sp5">This seems to be the fittest place to notice the existence of some fossil remains
  from the Palaeozoic rocks that cannot be fitly, or certainly, assigned to any of our existing
  Orders, and to which the above name has consequently been given. These remains consist chiefly of
  wings in a more or less imperfect state of preservation, and it is therefore quite doubtful
  whether the course of assigning them to a separate Order supposed to be extinct be correct. This
  is all the more doubtful when we recollect that an Insect fossil, <i>Eugereon bockingi</i>, having
  the head with mouth-parts of a Hemipterous or Dipterous nature, has been found, the wings attached
  to it being such as, had they been found separate, would have been considered to be Neuropterous,
  or at any rate allied thereto. About forty-two forms of Palaeodictyoptera are assigned by Scudder
  to a section called Neuropteroidea, and may therefore be considered to have a special resemblance
  to our Neuroptera. These Neuropteroidea comprise numerous genera and no less than six families.
  Scudder's view is at the best tentative, and is not very favourably received by some
  entomologists. Brauer has, indeed, objected altogether to the formation of this Order
  Palaeodictyoptera, and Brongniart has published a list of the Palaeozoic Insects in which a system
  of arrangement different to that of Scudder is adopted. In his most recent work<a id="NtA_408"
  href="#Nt_408"><sup>[408]</sup></a> Brongniart assigns some of these Neuropteroidea to the
  families Platypterides and Protodonates, which we have previously discussed. The whole subject of
  these Palaeozoic Insect remains is still in its infancy, and it would not be proper to accept any
  view as final that has yet been stated, nor would it be fair to dismiss the subject as unimportant
  because of the great divergence of opinion amongst the authorities who have investigated it.</p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Wings four, membranous, without scales, usually transparent, never very large,

    of the prothorax are disconnected from the pronotum and overlap the prosternum, usually entirely
    concealing it. The females are furnished at the extremity of the body with either saw, sting, or
    ovipositor; these parts may either be withdrawn into the body or be permanently protruded. The
    metamorphosis is great and abrupt, the chief changes being revealed in the pupa disclosed at the
    last moult of the larva; this moult is frequently delayed till long after growth has been
    completed. In the pupa the parts of the perfect Insect are seen nearly free, each covered in a
    very delicate skin.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>The term Hymenoptera includes ants, bees, wasps, sawflies, and the tribes of innumerable
  Ichneumon-flies. The Order is of enormous extent, consisting even at present of tens of thousands
  of described and named species, and yet these are but few in comparison with those that remain
  unknown. It has good claims to be considered the "highest" Order of Insects. Sir John Lubbock
  says: "If we judge animals by their intelligence as evinced in their actions, it is not the
  gorilla and the chimpanzee, but the bee, and above all the ant, which approach nearest to <span
  class="pagenum" id="page488"><span class="smaller">{488}</span></span>man."<a id="NtA_409"
  href="#Nt_409"><sup>[409]</sup></a> The mechanical perfection of the structures of the
  individuals, and the rapid and efficient manner in which their functions are discharged, are very
  remarkable. In many species of Hymenoptera the individuals have the habit of living together in
  great societies, in which the efforts of the members are combined for the support of the whole
  society and for the benefit of a younger generation. To fit them for this social life the bodies
  of the larger number of the individuals are more or less changed in structure, so that they become
  workers. These workers are in all cases imperfect females; besides carrying on the ordinary work
  of the society, they tend and feed the young. The duty of reproduction is restricted to a single
  female, called a queen, or to a small number of such individuals in each society. The males occupy
  an unimportant position in the society, and are usually much shorter-lived than the workers and
  queens. The social Hymenoptera do not form a single zoological group, but are of three different
  kinds&mdash;wasps, bees, and ants. There are numerous non-social, or solitary, wasps and bees.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the Order Hymenoptera&mdash;especially in the higher forms&mdash;the males and females are
  often different in appearance and structure. In the ants, one of the social groups, the workers,
  or imperfect females, are quite wingless. There are numerous other groups in which species, not
  social, are found, having the females wingless while the males have wings. In a few species there
  is an apterous condition of the male, perhaps usually only as a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page489"><span class="smaller">{489}</span></span>dimorphic form. In the parasitic division
  there are species that are apterous in both sexes. The structure of the outer skeleton, or
  external part of the body, exhibits some peculiarities, the chief of which is the detachment of
  the side-pieces of the prothorax and their great development. Not less remarkable is the
  abstraction of a segment from the abdomen to become, as it were, part of the thorax; while between
  the first and second true segments of the abdomen there exists a joint, or articulation, of the
  utmost mechanical perfection, enabling the operations of stinging and piercing to be executed with
  an accuracy that cannot be surpassed.</p>

  <p>As a result of the detachment of the thoracic side-pieces, the front legs and the structures
  connected with them are disjoined from the notum, as shown in Fig. 332, and act in connexion with
  the head, while the dorsal portion of the segment remains attached to the great thoracic mass. The
  head is quite free from the thorax and very mobile; the upper organs of the mouth&mdash;the labrum
  and the mandibles&mdash;are not subject to modifications equal to those exhibited by the maxillae
  and lower lip, which parts in the bees are prolonged to form a suctorial apparatus that may exceed
  in length the whole body of the Insect. The mandibles remain cutting or crushing implements even
  when the maxillae and lower lip are modified to form a suctorial apparatus of the kind we have
  mentioned; so that in the higher forms&mdash;ants, bees, and wasps&mdash;the mouth-pieces are
  completely differentiated for two sets of functions, one industrial, the other nutritive.</p>

  <p>Behind the head there is a large consolidated mass representing the thorax of other Insects,
  but made up, as we have already indicated, in an unusual manner, and which therefore may be called
  by a special name, the alitrunk (Fig. 333). The pronotum forms the anterior part of the alitrunk,
  with which it is usually very closely connected, being indeed frequently immovably soldered <span
  class="pagenum" id="page490"><span class="smaller">{490}</span></span>thereto.  It exhibits,
  however, considerable variety, and is seen in its simplest and least soldered state in
  <i>Cephus</i>. In the higher bees the pronotum takes on a form not seen in any other Insects,
  being one of the most beautiful sclerites to be found in the class (Fig. 334, pronotum of
  <i>Xylocopa</i>). We have already remarked that in Hymenoptera the lower portions of the
  prothoracic segment are detached from the upper, so that the pronotum is not supported beneath by
  a sternum as usual. In the bees in question the pronotum makes up for the removal of the
  corresponding side-pieces and sternum, by becoming itself a complete ring, its sides being
  prolonged and meeting in the middle line of the under surface of the body. At the same time a
  large lobe is developed laterally on each side, overlying and protecting the first breathing
  orifice. The intermediate stages of this remarkable modification may be observed by dissecting a
  small series of genera of bees.</p>

  <p>Although the prosternum of a Hymenopterous Insect is not usually visible owing to its being
  overwrapped by the side-pieces, it is really, as shown in Fig. 335, B, of complicated form. In
  <i>Cimbex</i> and some other sawflies the side-pieces are not so large as usual, but the
  prosternum is larger and is exposed. The prothoracic spiracle is rarely visible externally, but
  its position is remarkably constant, and is usually indicated by a peculiar lobe or angle of the
  pronotum projecting backwards just below <span class="pagenum" id="page491"><span
  class="smaller">{491}</span></span>the insertion of the front wing. This stigmatic lobe is
  frequently fringed with short hairs.</p>

  <p>The mesothorax is the largest of the three divisions of the thorax proper; its notum is large,
  and usually divided into two parts by a transverse suture. The side-pieces are so placed that the
  epimeron is rather behind than below the episternum. The mesosternum forms the larger part of the
  under-surface of the alitrunk. A very large phragma projects from the mesothorax into the interior
  of the body. The mesothoracic spiracle is usually not visible; its existence was unknown to the
  older entomotomists, who were in consequence led to consider the spiracle of the median segment as
  belonging to the thorax. The mesothoracic spiracle is, however, easily seen in <i>Cimbex</i>,
  placed in the suture between the mesothoracic epimeron and the metathoracic episternum, a little
  below the insertion of the front wing; close to this spot the mesophragma, just spoken of, comes,
  in <i>Cimbex</i>, to the surface. The mesothoracic spiracle is generally conspicuous in the worker
  ant. The parts of the metathorax are usually small, but so much variety prevails in this respect
  that no general description can be given.</p>

  <p>The structure of the posterior part of the alitrunk has given rise to an anatomical discussion
  that has extended over three-quarters of a century,<a id="NtA_410"
  href="#Nt_410"><sup>[410]</sup></a> with the result that it is now clear that the posterior part
  of what appears to be thorax in Hymenoptera is composed of an abdominal segment. This part has
  been called "Latreille's segment," the "median segment," and the "propodeum." The latter term was
  proposed by Newman, under the form of propodeon,<a id="NtA_411"
  href="#Nt_411"><sup>[411]</sup></a> and appears to be on the whole the most <span class="pagenum"
  id="page492"><span class="smaller">{492}</span></span>suitable term for this part, which is of
  great importance in systematic entomology, owing to the extreme variety of characters it affords.
  Although it is clear that the propodeum is, in large part, an abdominal segment, yet its
  morphology is still uncertain; what parts are pleural, what tergal, and what may be chitinised
  spiracular area, or portions of the metathorax, being undetermined. The ventral portion of the
  propodeum affords a strong contrast to the dorsal part, being so small that it has frequently been
  described as absent; it is, however, not difficult to detect it in the position shown at <i>d</i>,
  Fig. 333, B.</p>

  <p>Although the true first segment of the abdomen is detached from its normal position and added
  to the thorax, yet the term abdomen is conventionally restricted to the part that commences with
  the true second segment, which, in counting the number of abdominal segments, is reckoned as being
  the first. There are two modes of articulation of the Hymenopterous abdomen with the alitrunk; in
  one (Fig. 336, A) the base of the abdomen remains of the calibre usual in Insects, while in the
  other (Fig. 336, B) it is greatly contracted, so that the two parts are connected only by a
  slender stalk, the petiole. The petiole, besides articulating in a very perfect manner with the
  propodeum by means of certain prominences and notches, is also connected therewith by means of a
  slender ligament placed on its dorsal aspect and called the funiculus, shown in Fig. 333, A, just
  at the extremity of the pointing line <i>k</i>. This mode of articulation gives great freedom of
  motion, so that in some Petiolata (<i>Ampulex</i>) the abdomen can be doubled under the body and
  the sting brought to the head. It is worthy of note that even in the Sessiliventres&mdash;as the
  sub-Order with broad-based abdomen is called&mdash;some amount of movement exists at the
  corresponding spot; while, as shown in Fig. 336, A, between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, there exists an
  exposed membrane, the homologue of the funiculus.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The number of abdominal segments that can be seen in the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page493"><span class="smaller">{493}</span></span>perfect Insect varies greatly. In
  Tenthredinidae nine can be distinguished, while in some of the Chrysididae it is difficult to
  detect more than three behind the petiole. These distinctions are, however, superficial or
  secondary, being due to changes in the later life in connexion with the stings or borers; in the
  larvae that have been examined thirteen segments behind the head have usually been detected.</p>

  <p>Nothing is more remarkable in the Hymenoptera than the great differences that exist in the form
  of the petiole. This may be very short, as in the bees, so that the abdomen when not deflexed does
  not appear to be separated from the thorax (Fig. 331, C); in this condition it is said to be
  sessile, a term which it would be well to replace by that of pseudosessile. In many of the
  solitary wasps the petiole is very long. In ants it is replaced by one or two curiously-shaped
  small segments called nodes (Fig. 60, B, 2, 3), and in many ants these are provided with
  structures for the production of sound. The abdomen is formed by a system of double imbrications;
  each dorsal plate overlaps each ventral plate, and the hind margin of each segment embraces the
  front part of the one following; thus this part of the body has not only great mobility, but is
  also capable of much distension and extension. The pleura are apparently absent, but each one has
  really become a part of the dorsal plate of the segment to which it belongs. This is shown to be
  the case by <i>Cimbex</i>, where the division between pleuron and dorsal plate exists on each
  segment except the basal one. Owing to this arrangement, the abdominal stigmata in Hymenoptera
  appear to be placed on the dorsal plates.</p>

  <p>The organs for mechanical purposes existing at the extremity of the body in Hymenoptera exhibit
  a great diversity of form; they are saws, borers, piercers, or stings. Notwithstanding their great
  differences they are all, in their origin, essentially similar, and consist of six parts developed
  from limb-like prolongations on the penultimate and antepenultimate segments of the larva, as
  described by Packard and Dewitz.<a id="NtA_412" href="#Nt_412"><sup>[412]</sup></a> These
  processes have by some been thought to be not essentially different from abdominal legs, and
  Cholodkovsky has recently advocated this opinion.<a id="NtA_413"
  href="#Nt_413"><sup>[413]</sup></a></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page494"><span class="smaller">{494}</span></span></div>

  <p>The legs of bees exhibit modifications for industrial purposes. In the stinging Hymenoptera the
  trochanters are usually of a single piece, and these Insects are called monotrochous; but in most
  of the other forms the trochanters are more or less distinctly divided into two parts (Fig. 345,
  <i>b</i>). The usual number of joints in the tarsus is five, but is subject to diminution in many
  cases. In the bees and ants the first joint is altered in form; in the bees to act as an
  instrument for gathering or carrying pollen; in the ants to act, as it were, as a second tibia.
  Between the claws there is a very perfect pad, already described and figured on <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page106">106</a></span>.</p>

  <p>The wings are remarkable for the beautiful manner in which the hinder one is united to the
  anterior, so that the two act in flight as a single organ. The hind wing is furnished with a
  series of hooks, and the hind margin of the front wing is curled over so that the hooks catch on
  to it. In some of the parasitic forms the wings are almost destitute of nervures, and have no
  hooks. The powers of flight in these cases are probably but small, the wings merely serving to
  float the Insect in the air. In some Hymenoptera, especially in Pompilides and Xylocopa, the wings
  may be deeply pigmented or even metallic; and in some forms of Tenthredinidae, Ichneumonidae, and
  Braconidae the pigmentation assumes the form of definite patterns.</p>

  <p>The studies of the internal anatomy of Hymenoptera are at present by no means numerous or
  extensive. The alimentary canal (Fig. 69) possesses a crop, gizzard, and chylific stomach in
  addition to the oesophagus and intestine. The social Hymenoptera have the power of disgorging
  matter from the alimentary canal for the purpose of supplying food for their young.</p>

  <p>The crop&mdash;which is situated in the anterior part of the abdomen&mdash;is the reservoir
  that contains this matter. The mode of disgorgement is believed to be pressure exerted on the crop
  by contraction of the abdomen. Salivary glands are present in remarkable variety. The tracheal
  system possesses, in the higher winged forms, large saccular dilatations situated at the side of
  the abdomen. The nervous system is of peculiar interest on account of the high intelligence of
  many of the members of this Order; and on this point of the anatomy, Brandt<a id="NtA_414"
  href="#Nt_414"><sup>[414]</sup></a> has made rather extensive investigations, having examined it
  in the adult of seventy-eight species, and in the larva of twenty-two. In the adult there are two
  cephalic&mdash;the supra- and the sub-oesophageal&mdash;two or three thoracic, and from three to
  seven abdominal ganglia. The bees, wasps, and some other of the Aculeata have only two thoracic
  ganglia, while some ants have three. The supra-oesophageal ganglion is very large. The most
  remarkable fact revealed by Brandt's investigations is the great difference that exists between
  the sexes and the worker caste in the same species. The <span class="pagenum" id="page496"><span
  class="smaller">{496}</span></span>pedunculate bodies of the supra-oesophageal ganglion are
  considered to be in their development correlative with that of the intelligence or instinct. In
  the workers of the social Hymenoptera these bodies are very large, while in the males and females
  they are small. The workers and females of <i>Bombus</i> have six abdominal ganglia, while the
  males have only five; and the worker of the honey-bee has five abdominal ganglia, while the male
  and the queen-bee have but four. In the leaf-cutting bee (<i>Megachile</i>) the male has four
  abdominal ganglia and the female five, and in the wasps the workers have five, the males and
  females six. The nervous system in the larvae shows but little difference between the ganglia,
  which are thirteen in number, eight being abdominal. In the embryo of the bee Kowalewsky has
  observed seventeen ganglia. The changes that take place from the embryonic to the imago condition
  are therefore directed to the reduction in number of the ganglia, which is accomplished by the
  fusion of some of them. In the adult Hymenopterous Insect it would appear that the first abdominal
  ganglion is always joined with the last thoracic.</p>

  <p><b>Sub-Orders.</b>&mdash;The distinction in the form of the abdominal articulation, previously
  alluded to (<span class="wnw">p. <a href="#page492">492</a></span>, Fig. 336, A, B), divides the
  Hymenoptera into two great sub-Orders, the members of which are very different in their habits and
  life-histories. The Sessiliventres are plant-eaters; their larvae (Fig. 343, A) are provided with
  legs, and are able to procure their vegetable food for themselves. The larvae of the Petiolata are
  maggot-like and helpless, and are dependent for food on supplies afforded them by their parents or
  companions. It is said by Dewitz that although the larvae of the Petiolata appear to be legless,
  there are thoracic legs within the body. The metamorphosis, so far as it is known, and the early
  life-history of the Sessiliventres are very similar to those of butterflies and moths, except that
  the pupa is soft and has no hard external skin. A few of these plant-eating Sessiliventres become
  carnivorous in the perfect state&mdash;a change of habit that is most unusual in Insects, though
  the reverse occurrence is common. The larvae of the Petiolata exhibit, in the cases that have been
  examined, the peculiarity that the alimentary canal has not any outlet posteriorly until the
  termination of the larval stage of existence is approaching. In some cases there is no anal
  orifice; in others this orifice exists, <span class="pagenum" id="page497"><span
  class="smaller">{497}</span></span>but there is no communication between the stomach and the
  posterior intestine.</p>

  <p>Packard informs us<a id="NtA_415" href="#Nt_415"><sup>[415]</sup></a> that in <i>Bombus</i> the
  larva, after it is full fed, passes into the pupa state (Fig. 331, A, B) by a series of
  transformations accompanied by moultings of the skin. Packard's statements have been confirmed by
  others, but details have not been fully given, so that the number of the moults, their intervals
  and other particulars, are still unknown. We have remarked that the pupal instar is very like the
  perfect instar, except that it is colourless and soft, and that each of the members is wrapped in
  a very delicate skin; the colour appears gradually. This metamorphosis exhibits important
  differences from that of the Lepidoptera. Packard calls the Insect, during the stages of
  transformation from the full-fed larva to the pupa, the semi-pupa; the later stages of the pupa,
  when the colouring has appeared, he terms the subimago. Altogether he considers there is a series
  of at least ten moultings of the skin. His ideas were apparently derived from examination of a
  series of specimens after death rather than from observation of the development in living
  individuals. The parasitic forms of Hymenoptera have apparently extraordinary metamorphoses of
  very varied kinds.</p>

  <p><b>Parthenogenesis.</b>&mdash;One of the most remarkable facts connected with this Order is the
  prevalence of parthenogenesis in a considerable number of widely separated species. In many of
  these Hymenoptera it is not a mere occasional occurrence, but plays an important part in the
  continuity of the species; indeed, it is believed that in some members of the Order the
  reproduction is entirely parthenogenetic. We shall give particulars as to some of these cases in
  subsequent chapters, and will here make some remarks on the different forms of parthenogenesis
  existing in the Order. The three forms of parthenogenesis mentioned on <span class="wnw">p. <a
  href="#page141">141</a></span> all occur in Hymenoptera. In the gall-making Cynipidae
  parthenogenesis is frequently accompanied with alternation of generations, a generation consisting
  of the two sexes being followed by another consisting entirely of females, which in its turn gives
  origin to a bisexual generation. In this case deuterotokous parthenogenesis is established as a
  part of the normal economy of the species. This same form of parthenogenesis also occurs in other
  species of Cynipidae unaccompanied by alternation <span class="pagenum" id="page498"><span
  class="smaller">{498}</span></span>of generations. Thus in <i>Rhodites rosae</i> the generations
  resemble one another, and the male is very rare, but is still occasionally produced,<a
  id="NtA_416" href="#Nt_416"><sup>[416]</sup></a> and the same condition exists in other Cynipidae.
  According to the observations of Adler, we may assume that the male, in the latter cases, is
  useless, the continuation of the species being effected by virgin females although males exist.
  Deuterotokous parthenogenesis also occurs in the sawflies, but as a comparatively rare
  phenomenon.<a id="NtA_417" href="#Nt_417"><sup>[417]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Thelyotokous parthenogenesis is common in sawflies, and it also occurs in some Cynipidae. There
  are several species of this latter family in which no males have ever been found.<a id="NtA_418"
  href="#Nt_418"><sup>[418]</sup></a> The phenomena in <i>Rhodites rosae</i> we have mentioned, give
  rise to the idea that in that species deuterotokous parthenogenesis occurs as an exception, the
  species being usually thelyotokous. A most remarkable case of thelyotokous parthenogenesis is said
  to exist in the case of the parasitic ant <i>Tomognathus</i>. This species is said to be
  monomorphic, only the female existing, and reproducing by uninterrupted parthenogenesis.</p>

  <p>Arrhenotokous parthenogenesis&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> parthenogenesis in which the progeny is
  entirely of the male sex&mdash;occurs in several species of sawflies. We find it also occurring in
  the case of the social Hymenoptera; the workers of ants, bees, and wasps occasionally produce eggs
  parthenogenetically, and the progeny in these cases is always of the male sex. In the honey-bee
  the queen sometimes produces eggs before she has been fertilised, and the parthenogenetic young
  are then always of the male sex.</p>

  <p>Some species of Hymenoptera exhibit two forms of parthenogenesis. In <i>Nematus curtispina</i>
  the parthenogenetic generation is generally of the male sex, but a female is occasionally
  produced;<a id="NtA_419" href="#Nt_419"><sup>[419]</sup></a> while in <i>Hemichroa rufa</i>
  parthenogenesis may result in either deuterotokous or thelyotokous progeny. No case is yet known
  of a species exhibiting the three forms of parthenogenesis. From this review we may conclude that
  parthenogenesis does not favour the formation of one sex more than another; but it is clear that
  it decidedly favours the production of a brood that is <span class="pagenum" id="page499"><span
  class="smaller">{499}</span></span>entirely of one sex, but which sex that is differs according to
  other circumstances.</p>

  <p><b>Production of Sex.</b>&mdash;It is believed that a very peculiar form of parthenogenesis
  exists in the honey-bee, and it is confidently stated that the drones, or males, of that species
  are always produced from unfertilised eggs. These views are commonly called the Dzierzon theory,
  and are widely accepted. They assume that the eggs are male till fertilised, and then become
  female. After the queen-bee is fertilised most of the spermatozoa soon find their way into a small
  chamber, the spermatheca, near the posterior orifice of the body; it is believed that each egg may
  be fertilised as it passes the door of this chamber, and that the eggs that produce females
  (<i>i.e.</i> workers or queens) are so fertilised, but that the eggs that produce drones are not
  fertilised. Hence it is supposed that the sex is determined by this act of fertilisation, and
  Cheshire has described what he calls an apparatus for differentiating the sexes. It is also
  confidently stated that no male honey-bee ever has a father.</p>

  <p>The facts we have stated as to the sexes resulting from parthenogenetic reproduction in
  Hymenoptera generally, are extremely opposed to the Dzierzon theory, in so far as this relates to
  the production of sex. There have always been entomologists<a id="NtA_420"
  href="#Nt_420"><sup>[420]</sup></a> who have considered this view unsatisfactory, and the
  observations of several recent French naturalists<a id="NtA_421"
  href="#Nt_421"><sup>[421]</sup></a> are unfavourable to the idea that the sex of an egg is
  determined by its fertilisation.</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt that the queen honey-bee frequently produces males parthenogenetically,
  and the error of the views we are alluding to consists in taking the parthenogenesis to be the
  cause of the sex of the individual. It must be recollected that the laying of an unfertilised egg
  by a fertilised female may be different physiologically from the laying of an egg by an
  unfertilised female; for, though both have as result an unfertilised egg, it is possible that the
  fertilisation of the female may initiate processes that modify the sex of the eggs produced by the
  ovaries, so that though these may produce previous to fertilisation only male eggs, yet after
  fertilisation they may produce eggs of the opposite sex or of both sexes. In other <span
  class="pagenum" id="page500"><span class="smaller">{500}</span></span>words, the act of
  fertilisation may initiate a different condition of nutrition of the ovaries, and this may
  determine the sex of the eggs produced.</p>

  <p><b>Polymorphism, or Castes.</b>&mdash;The question of the causes of the modified individuals
  forming the various castes of the social Hymenoptera has been much discussed. These individuals
  are many of them very different in size and structure from either of their parents, and are also
  different in their habits and instincts. This difficult subject is far from being completely
  elucidated. In the case of the honey-bee it is well established that an egg of the female sex can,
  after deposition, be made either into a queen or a worker-bee by the mode of nutrition&mdash;using
  that word in the largest sense. On the other hand, Dewitz thought that in the case of the ant
  <i>Formica rufa</i>, the caste&mdash;whether worker or winged female&mdash;is already determined
  in the Insect before leaving the egg.<a id="NtA_422" href="#Nt_422"><sup>[422]</sup></a> Weismann
  and others associate the caste with some hypothetic rudiments they consider to exist at the very
  earliest stage of the embryonic, or oogenetic process.</p>

  <p>Herbert Spencer says:<a id="NtA_423" href="#Nt_423"><sup>[423]</sup></a> "Among these social
  Insects the sex is determined by degree of nutrition while the egg is being formed," and "after an
  egg, predetermined as a female, has been laid, the character of the produced Insect as a perfect
  female or imperfect female is determined by the nutrition of the larva. <i>That is, one set of
  differences in structure and instincts is determined by nutrition before the egg is laid, and a
  further set of differences in structures and instincts is determined by nutrition after the egg is
  laid.</i>"</p>

  <p>Spencer's generalisation is not inconsistent with the facts hitherto brought to light, though
  it is possible that the progress of knowledge may show some variety as to the periods of the
  development at which the commencements of the modifications occur.</p>

  <p>Fig. 339 represents the chief castes, or adult forms, existing in a community of one of the
  most highly developed of the species of social Hymenoptera, the leaf-cutting ant, <i>Atta
  cephalotes</i>. We shall, when dealing with Formicidae, enter into some details as to these and
  other cases of polymorphism.</p>

  <p>Our object at present is to bring to the eye of the reader the great diversity of outer form
  that is believed, rightly or wrongly, to result from the mode of treatment of the young. And we
  will also take this opportunity of more fully illustrating the remark we made on <span
  class="wnw">p. <a href="#page85">85</a></span> as to the profound distinctions that exist between
  ants and white ants, or Termites, notwithstanding the remarkable analogies that we shall find to
  exist in many of their social arrangements.</p>

  <p>The analogies we allude to, coupled with the fact that there is a certain general resemblance
  in outer form between the workers of Termites and ants, and even between the extraordinary castes
  called soldiers in the two groups, have given rise to the idea that there is a zoological
  relationship between the social forms of Neuroptera and Hymenoptera. The two are, however,
  zoologically amongst the most different of Insects. The external skeleton in Termites is
  remarkable for its imperfect development, the sclerites being small and isolated, while the
  segmental differentiation of the body is low (Fig. 225, etc.), so that there is no difficulty in
  counting the segments. In ants the reverse is the case as regards both these facts, the various
  segments being most unequal, so that their homologies have only been detected after prolonged
  studies, while the chitinisation and articulation of the various parts is so complete that the ant
  may be described as cased in armour, fitting together so exactly that it is difficult anywhere to
  introduce the point of a needle into its chinks. The wings of the two kinds of Insects are also
  extremely different. The differences between the modes of growth and development of the two sets
  of Insects are as profound as the distinctions in their anatomy. Termitidae belong to the division
  of Insects in which the wings are developed outside the body; Hymenoptera to the division in which
  they are developed inside the body. In Termites the growth of the individual is slow, and the
  final form is reached gradually. In the ants the growth is carried on with great rapidity, and
  during it the Insect is a helpless maggot absolutely dependent on the attentions of its seniors,
  while the difference in form and structure between the ant-larva and the ant are enormous. Both
  anatomy and ontogeny are profoundly different in ants and Termites. To these distinctions must be
  added, as of much importance, the fact that in Hymenoptera only the female sex <span
  class="pagenum" id="page503"><span class="smaller">{503}</span></span>is modified for the division
  of labour, while in Termites both sexes undergo this change. Hence it is impossible to suppose
  that the remarkable analogies that exist between the societies of ants and those of Termites are
  due to any common origin. It is probably to some similar physiological susceptibilities in the
  ancestors, at an extremely remote epoch, of both groups that we must look for an explanation of
  the interesting resemblances in the social lives of ants and Termites.</p>

  <p>The Hymenoptera are no doubt one of the largest Orders of Insects, the species of the parasitic
  tribes being apparently innumerable. No doubt 250,000 species of the Order exist, and possibly the
  number may prove to be very much larger. Up to the present time 25,000 or 30,000 have been
  discovered. No remains of Insects of this Order, of older age than the Lias, have been brought to
  light; it is indeed doubtful whether the fossils considered to be Hymenopterous of the period
  referred to are really such.</p>

  <p>The Order, as already mentioned, consists of two very distinct sub-Orders, viz.<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p>1. <i>Hymenoptera Sessiliventres.</i>&mdash;Insects with the abdomen broad at the base, its
    first segment not completely amalgamated with the thorax.</p>
    <p class="sp0">2. <i>Hymenoptera Petioliventres</i> or <i>Petiolata</i>.&mdash;The abdomen
    connected with what appears to be the thorax by a slender joint, the posterior part of the
    apparent thorax consisting of an abdominal segment.</p>
  </div>

  <p><b>Hymenoptera Sessiliventres.</b>&mdash;This group has been variously called <i>Hymenoptera
  phytophaga</i>, <i>H. securifera</i>, <i>H. sessiliventres</i>, <i>H. serrifera</i>, <i>H.
  symphyta</i>. We prefer an old term, taken from a character that enables us to recognise at a
  glance which group a species belongs to. The division or sub-Order may be formally defined as
  follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Abdomen nearly continuous in outline with the thorax, the two parts having a
    broad connexion instead of a small highly mobile articulation. Anal lobe of hind wings usually
    of considerable size. Trochanters ditrochous (transversely divided into two, Fig. 345).
    Extremity of body of female furnished with saws or boring instruments, usually concealed, in
    some cases visible in part. Larvae with complex mouth-parts; three pairs of thoracic legs
    (imperfect in Cephidae and <span class="pagenum" id="page504"><span
    class="smaller">{504}</span></span>Siricidae), and frequently with numerous abdominal legs,
    which are destitute of hooks. Food vegetable.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>The Insects of this sub-Order never exhibit the highly specialised habits and activity of the
  better known petiolate Hymenoptera. Though the food in the larval stages is always vegetable,
  there is considerable variety in the larvae and their habits; some feed in galls, some in the
  twigs of plants, some in the hard wood of trees and shrubs. The majority, however, live on the
  leaves of plants. Those that live in wood (Fig. 342, C) resemble in appearance Coleopterous larvae
  that have similar habits, and those that live on leaves (Fig. 343, A) resemble Lepidopterous
  larvae that do likewise. There are four families included in the sub-Order, viz. Cephidae,
  Oryssidae, Siricidae, Tenthredinidae.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The British Sessiliventres&mdash;under the name Phytophagous Hymenoptera&mdash;have
  recently been monographed by Mr. Peter Cameron in a series of vols. published by the Ray
  Society.<a id="NtA_424" href="#Nt_424"><sup>[424]</sup></a> These contain many figures and many
  details relating to natural history, in addition to the descriptions of genera and species.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Fam. I. Cephidae&mdash;Stem Sawflies.</b></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Slender Insects, with weak integument; free, more or less elongate pronotum;
    one spine on the front tibia. Larvae living in the stems of plants or in the tender shoots of
    trees and shrubs.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>The obscure little Insects composing this family have slender antennae of peculiar form,
  composed of eighteen to thirty joints, two of which are short and stout; then come several long
  joints, with more or less power of movement, the terminal portion consisting of an elongate club
  of many joints with little power of movement. The pronotum is longer than is usual in the
  Hymenoptera, and instead of being very closely connected with the mesonotum, it is free and
  mobile, although its base overwraps the front of the mesonotum. The median plate (<i>i.e.</i> the
  dorsal plate connecting the thorax and abdomen) is divided to the base along the middle, the
  divisions being separated by a membranous piece broader behind; the anal lobe of the posterior
  <span class="pagenum" id="page505"><span class="smaller">{505}</span></span>wings is small but
  distinct. The female bears a saw at the extremity of the body, but it is covered by two flaps;
  these form a short, terminal projection. Although too much neglected, the Cephidae are really of
  great interest as being of more imperfect or primitive structure than any of the other families of
  Hymenoptera. The larval history has been traced in several species. <i>C. pygmaeus</i> is
  sometimes very injurious to corn crops on the continent of Europe, and even in our own country its
  effects in this respect are considered to be occasionally serious. The egg is laid in the stem of
  the corn plant; the larva soon hatches and eats its way upwards in the stem. It is a soft grub,
  apparently footless, but really possessing six small projections in place of thoracic legs. It
  occupies all the summer in feeding, and when full fed and about to prepare for its metamorphosis,
  it weakens the stem by a sort of girdling process below the ear; it then descends in the stem to
  near the root, where it constructs a transparent cocoon, in which it passes the winter as a larva,
  changing to a chrysalis in the month of May, and completing its development by appearing as a
  perfect Insect shortly thereafter. The girdling operation is very injurious, and causes the corn
  stem, when ripe or nearly so, to break in two under the influence of a strong wind, so that the
  ears fall to the ground.</p>

  <p>The history of <i>C. integer</i> has been given by Riley. This Insect attacks the young shoots
  of willows in North America. Riley states<a id="NtA_425" href="#Nt_425"><sup>[425]</sup></a> that
  by a wonderful instinct the female, after she has consigned her egg to the twig, girdles the
  latter, preventing it from growing any further, and from crushing the egg by so doing. The larva
  after hatching eats downwards, sometimes destroying a length of two feet of the twig; when full
  grown it fills the bottom of the burrow with frass, and then previous to making its cocoon eats a
  passage through the side of the shoot about a quarter of an inch above the spot where the cocoon
  will be placed, thus making it easy for the perfect Insect to effect its <span class="pagenum"
  id="page506"><span class="smaller">{506}</span></span>escape; it leaves the bark, however,
  untouched, and is thus protected in its retreat. A delicate transparent cocoon is then spun in
  which the larva passes the winter, changing to a pupa in the following March, and emerging as a
  perfect Insect about six weeks thereafter.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Somewhat less than 100 species of this family are at present known; the great
  majority are found in the Mediterranean region, but there are several in North America. As a
  single species is known from Mexico and another from Japan, it is probable that the family may
  prove to have a wider geographical extension than at present appears to be the case.</p>

  <p>This family consists of the genus <i>Oryssus</i>, and includes only about twenty species, but
  is nevertheless very widely distributed over the world. They are very rare Insects, and little is
  known as to their habits; one species, <i>O. abietinus</i>, was formerly found in England. Should
  any one be so fortunate as to meet with it, he can scarcely fail to recognise it on noticing the
  peculiar situation of the base of the antennae. In this respect the Chrysididae somewhat resemble
  <i>Oryssus</i>, but in that group of Hymenoptera the hind body or abdomen is remarkably mobile, so
  that the Insects can coil themselves up by bending at this joint; whereas in <i>Oryssus</i> the
  hind body is very closely amalgamated with the thorax&mdash;more so, in fact, than in any other
  Hymenopterous Insect&mdash;and has no power of independent movement.</p>

  <p>The Insects of this family are usually of large size and of bright conspicuous colours; these,
  however, frequently differ greatly in the sexes of the same species, and may be very variable even
  in one sex. The antennae are filiform and usually elongate; the head is usually contiguous with
  the thorax, but in one division, Xyphidriides, it is exserted and separated from the thorax by a
  well-marked neck. The pronotum is attached to the mesonotum, and possesses very little, if any,
  freedom of movement; it varies in its size, being sometimes conspicuous <span class="pagenum"
  id="page508"><span class="smaller">{508}</span></span>from above; in the Xyphidriides it is
  smaller, and in the middle is entirely vertical in its direction. The mesonotum is moderate in
  size, and its divisions are delimited by broad vague depressions. The prosternum appears to be
  entirely membranous, but the prosternal plates (pleura) are large, and meet together accurately in
  the middle, so as to protect the greater part of the under-surface of the neck. The abdomen is
  cylindrical or somewhat flattened above; it has seven dorsal plates in addition to the
  spine-bearing terminal segment. The trochanters are double, the outer division being, however,
  short; the anterior tibia has only one spur; the anal lobe of the posterior wings is large. The
  "borer" or ovipositor of the female is a remarkable organ; it is held projecting directly
  backwards from the extremity of the body, and has the appearance of being a powerful sting. The
  apparatus is much longer than it appears, for it proceeds not from the apex of the body, but from
  the under-surface far forwards, so that the part exposed is only about one-half of the total
  length; it consists of a pair of elongate sheaths, which are easily separable though they wrap
  together, and enclose a slender tube. This tube is rigid and quite straight; though appearing
  solid, it is really composed of two very perfectly adjusted laminae and a third arched piece or
  roof. The two lower laminae are called the spiculae; they are serrated or grooved in a peculiar
  manner near the tip, and although so closely adjusted to the borer or upper piece of the tube as
  to appear to form one solid whole with it, they are said to be capable of separate motion. In
  addition to these parts, the termination of the abdomen bears above a shorter piece that projects
  in a parallel plane, and forms a sort of thick spine above the ventral pieces we have described;
  this process is very strong, and has in the middle of its under-face in <i>Sirex gigas</i> a
  membranous cavity, replaced in <i>S. juvencus</i>, according to Westwood, by a pair of minute
  pilose styles. The Insect, by means of this powerful apparatus, is enabled to deposit her eggs in
  the solid wood of trees, in which the larva sometimes penetrates to the depth of eight inches.</p>

  <p><i>Sirex gigas</i> is one of the most remarkable of our British Insects, but is little known
  except to entomologists, being usually rare. On the continent of Europe it is, however, an
  abundant Insect, especially in the neighbourhood of forests of fir-trees, and is a cause of
  considerable terror. As the Insect is not <span class="pagenum" id="page509"><span
  class="smaller">{509}</span></span>capable of inflicting much injury to the person, it is probable
  that the peculiar ovipositor is believed to be a sting. The eggs are laid&mdash;it is said to the
  number of 100&mdash;in the solid wood of fir-trees, but not in perfectly healthy wood; the reason
  for this, it is thought, being that in a healthy tree the great affluence of sap caused by the
  burrows and presence of the Insect would be injurious to the latter. The <i>Sirex</i> will,
  however, attack a perfectly healthy tree immediately after it has been felled. The larva, small at
  first, enlarges its burrows as itself grows larger, and thus the wood of a tree may be rendered
  completely useless for trade purposes, although there may be very little outward indication of
  unsoundness. The larva (Fig. 342, C, larva of <i>Tremex</i>) is a pallid, maggot-like creature,
  with six projections representing thoracic legs; there are no other legs behind these, but some
  slight protuberances take their place; the terminal segment is enlarged, and bears a hard spine.
  There is a difference of opinion as to the duration of the life of the larva, Kollar saying that
  in seven weeks after the deposition of the egg the maggot is full fed, while others consider that
  it takes two years to attain this condition; the latter statement is more probably correct, it
  being the rule that the life of wood-feeding larvae is more than usually prolonged. After becoming
  full fed, the Insect may still pass a prolonged period in the wood before emerging as a perfect
  Insect. As a result of this it not infrequently happens that the Insect emerges from wood that has
  been carried to a distance, and used for buildings or for furniture. A case is recorded in which
  large numbers of a species of <i>Sirex</i> emerged in a house in this country some years after it
  was built, to the great terror of the inhabitants. The wood in this case was supposed to have been
  brought from Canada.</p>

  <p>Fabre has studied<a id="NtA_426" href="#Nt_426"><sup>[426]</sup></a> the habits of the larva of
  <i>Sirex augur</i>, and finds that it forms tortuous galleries in the direction of the
  longitudinal axis of the tree or limb, and undergoes its metamorphosis in the interior, leaving to
  the perfect Insect the task of finding its way out; this the creature does, not by retracing its
  path along the gallery formed by the larva, but by driving a fresh one at right angles to the
  previous course, thus selecting the shortest way to freedom. By what perception or sense it
  selects the road to the exterior is quite unknown. Fabre is not <span class="pagenum"
  id="page510"><span class="smaller">{510}</span></span>able to suggest any sort of perception that
  might enable the larva to pursue the right course, and considers it must be accomplished by means
  of some sensibility we do not possess. Fabre's observation is the opposite of what has been
  recorded in the case of <i>S. gigas</i>, where the larva is said to prepare the way for the exit
  of the perfect Insect.</p>

  <p>Individuals of <i>Sirex</i> are often found in dried and solid wood, encased by metal. When the
  Insect finds itself so confined, it gnaws its way through the metal, if this be lead, and escapes.
  The perseverance displayed by the Insect in these circumstances seems to indicate a knowledge of
  the direction in which liberty is to be found.</p>

  <p>About 100 species of Siricidae are known. They form two sub-families<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p>1. <i>Siricides</i>: back of head nearly or quite contiguous with the pronotum.</p>
    <p class="sp0">2. <i>Xyphidriides</i>: back of head separated from the pronotum by an elongate
    neck.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">We are reputed to possess in Britain two species of each of these sub-families, but
  it is doubtful whether more than one Siricid is truly native. <i>Sirex gigas</i> is frequently
  brought over in timber, and certainly breeds at times freely in Britain. Mr. Leech has recorded
  the occurrence of the larvae in abundance in fir-trees in the neighbourhood of Dublin. <i>Sirex
  juvencus</i> is more rarely met with. <i>Xyphidria camelus</i> is doubtless a native, though now
  apparently rare. It used to occur about old willows, near London, in the New Forest, and, I
  believe, also in the neighbourhood of Cambridge.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Fam. IV. Tenthredinidae&mdash;Sawflies.</b></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Hymenoptera Sessiliventres, having the pronotum small, accurately adapted to

    caterpillars, but a few inhabit galls.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>The sawflies are an important family of Insects, their species being numerous, while some of
  them are, in the larval state, very destructive to vegetables and fruit. Being quiet creatures,
  rarely seen on the wing, they are, though common Insects in this <span class="pagenum"
  id="page511"><span class="smaller">{511}</span></span>country, but little known, and few persons
  recognise a sawfly as such. They are usually of small or moderate size, and the numerous species
  have a great family resemblance. This remark requires some qualification in the case of the
  Cimbicides, they being Insects of larger size&mdash;usually surpassing the honey-bee&mdash;of more
  robust structure, and with greater powers of flight.</p>

  <p>The antennae are remarkably variable in form and structure. Cameron considers that nine should
  be taken as the normal number of their joints; but there are only three in <i>Hylotoma</i>, while
  in <i>Lyda</i> there may be forty or more. The head is usually held closely applied to the thorax,
  but is really borne on a neck capable of much elongation (Fig. 332). The pronotum forms a part of
  the alitrunk, but is not soldered thereto. Usually the prosternum is more or less completely
  concealed by the side-pieces, but in Cimbicides it is larger and conspicuous, the side-pieces
  being in this group smaller than usual. The dorsal pieces of the mesothorax have their relative
  proportions different to what we find them in the other families of Sessiliventres, and even in
  most of the other Hymenoptera. There is first an antero-median lobe of triangular shape
  projecting, like a wedge, far backwards, into the great lateral lobes. These latter form the
  larger part of the area of the mesonotum; they meet together in the middle line, and behind are
  separated by a deep depression from the posterior lobe, or scutellum of the mesothorax, which is
  frequently divided into two parts, the anterior being the so-called scutum. The pieces of the
  metanotum are short and obscure, owing to the great unevenness of their parts; on each side of the
  middle there is a small membranous space of pallid colour. The cenchri, as these spaces are
  called, are, in <i>Lyda</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page512"><span
  class="smaller">{512}</span></span>delicate, membranous, depressed spaces, in front of each of
  which there stands up a flap of membrane. The function of the cenchri is quite unknown. The median
  plate is fastened to the hind margin of the metanotum, and looks quite like one of the dorsal
  plates of the following abdominal segments, from which, however, it is separated by a more or less
  conspicuous membrane. In the majority of the Tenthredinidae the median plate is divided along the
  middle, but in the Cimbicides this is not the case. The mesosternum is very large, and the
  metasternum small, so that the middle and hinder pairs of coxae are placed close together. The
  abdomen consists of nine segments, there being eight dorsal plates in addition to the median
  plate, and seven ventral plates besides the terminal armature. There is a pair of short cerci,
  each of a single segment. The trochanters are divided; each tibia bears two spurs at the
  extremity, and the tarsi are 5-jointed.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The most characteristic and interesting of the structures with which the Insects of this family
  are provided is the apparatus from which the name of sawfly is derived. As long as two centuries
  ago these instruments excited the admiration of Vallisnieri and of R&eacute;aumur, who described them at
  length; and it is truly astonishing that any part of a living being should be changed into tools
  so mechanically perfect as these saws are (Fig. 344). They serve the purpose of assisting the
  female in depositing the eggs in a suitable situation, the place selected being frequently the
  tender stems of shrubs or other plants, or the interior of leaves. These organs are therefore of
  course possessed only by the female. They are placed on the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page513"><span class="smaller">{513}</span></span>lower aspect of the hinder extremity of the
  body, where they are enclosed and protected by a pair of sheaths, from which they can be made to
  protrude by a little pressure exercised on the parts immediately in front of them. Each female
  possesses a pair of these saws; they consist of thin laminae of very hard consistence, and are not
  only toothed at their edge, but in many cases each tooth is itself serrate; at the same time the
  outer face of the saw is sculptured or plicate in a remarkable manner, so that the saw in this way
  acts as a file or rasp. The Insect having selected a suitable place, uses the saws by placing the
  extremity of the abdomen against a twig or leaf, protruding the blades, which, moving with an
  alternate motion, one being thrust forward while the other is retracted, act on the plant so as to
  make an incision. Each saw is directed in its movement by the support, the pair of supports being
  united at the base by membrane as shown in Fig. 344. In the case of some
  species,&mdash;<i>Hylotoma rosae</i>, the common sawfly of our rose-bushes, for
  instance&mdash;there is no difficulty in observing the operation; indeed old R&eacute;aumur, when
  speaking of the placid disposition of the sawflies, suggests that it was given them so that we may
  easily observe their charming operations. We cannot but regret that in these days we are unable to
  take so complacent a view of the arrangements of nature. There is much variety in the details of
  the structure of these saws; so much indeed that it is possible to identify most of the species by
  means of the saw alone. According to certain observers, the eggs are laid by some kinds on, not
  in, the leaves, so that we may conclude that in these cases the saws are not used by their
  possessors. An incision having been made, an egg is placed in it, and also a drop of some liquid
  matter. The egg is at first small, but soon increases till it becomes twice or three times its
  former size, and the development of the embryo commences.</p>

  <p>The larvae of the Tenthredinidae exhibit great variety, and are indeed in this respect more
  interesting than the perfect Insects. The usual rule is that the larvae much resembles those of
  Lepidopterous Insects, and feed exposed on plants in the same way as Lepidopterous larvae do. But
  the exceptions are numerous; sometimes the larva is covered with slime, and thus protected from
  various enemies. In other cases it is very depressed, a broad creature, of irregular outline,
  living closely <span class="pagenum" id="page514"><span
  class="smaller">{514}</span></span>attached to the leaf, somewhat after the fashion of a huge
  scale-Insect. Some larvae mine between the layers of a leaf, others roll up leaves; a few live in
  the stems of plants, and one or two inside fruits. Even this does not complete the list of their
  habits, for a few species of <i>Nematus</i> live in galls caused by the deposition of the egg. A
  species of <i>Lyda</i> forms for itself a case out of bits of leaves, and carries this habitation
  about with it after the fashion of the Phryganeidae. The number of legs in these larvae is
  unusually great, varying from eighteen to twenty-two&mdash;that is, three pairs of thoracic legs
  and eight of abdominal or pro-legs. This character offers a ready means of distinguishing, in the
  majority of cases, these larvae from those of the Lepidoptera in which the number of legs varies,
  but is only from ten to sixteen; moreover, the pro-legs in sawflies are destitute of the circles
  of hooklets that exist in Lepidoptera. This mode of identifying the immature stages of the
  Tenthredinidae is not, however, always satisfactory, as there are some of these larvae that have
  no pro-legs at all, but only the three thoracic pairs. Another point of distinction exists,
  inasmuch as the larvae of the sawflies have only one ocellus on each side of the head, whereas in
  the Lepidopterous caterpillars the rule is that there are several of these little eyes on each
  side. In addition to this, we should mention that the Lepidopterous larva never has any pro-legs
  on the fifth body-segment, whereas in the sawflies when pro-legs are present there is always a
  pair on the segment in question.</p>

  <p>These larvae are of various colours, but the patterns and markings they exhibit are not quite
  like those of the Lepidoptera, though it would be difficult to make any correct general statement
  as to the nature of the differences. The variety of their postures is very remarkable; and in
  respect of these also Tenthredinidae differ considerably from Lepidoptera. Some of them hold the
  posterior part of the body erect, clasping the leaf by their anterior legs; others keep the
  posterior part of the body curled up (Fig. 343, A), and some combine these methods by curving the
  posterior part of the body and holding it away from the food. These attitudes, like the general
  form, are characteristic for each species. The <i>Nematus</i> larvae that inhabit galls possess
  all the characteristics of those that feed externally. As a rule the skin of the larva is naked
  and free from hair, but it is often minutely tuberculate, and in a few species it is armed <span
  class="pagenum" id="page515"><span class="smaller">{515}</span></span>with remarkable forked
  spines. These spines may exist during part of the larval life, and completely disappear at one of
  the moults. The creatures are as a rule very sluggish, and move about much less than Lepidopterous
  larvae; many of them, when alarmed, have the power of exuding a disagreeable liquid, either from
  the mouth or from pores in the skin; in the latter case it may be sent as a sort of spray to some
  little distance from the body. This operation is said to be very efficacious as a means of
  protecting the larvae from the attacks of parasitic flies that are desirous of laying eggs in
  their bodies. One peculiarity as to their colour has attracted the attention of R&eacute;aumur and
  subsequent naturalists, namely, that in the case of many species a great change takes place in the
  colour during the life of the larva, and more especially at the period of the last moult. The
  change to the pupal state usually takes place in a cocoon, and some species have the peculiar
  habit of forming a double cocoon, the outer one being hard and coarse, while the inner is
  beautifully delicate. The cocoon is sometimes formed in the earth, and in that case it may be to a
  large extent composed of earthy matter. The Insect frequently remains a long time in its cocoon
  before emerging as a perfect Insect; however long this time may be, it is nearly all of it passed
  in the larval state; when the Insect does change to a pupa it speedily thereafter emerges as a
  perfect Insect. In the pupa the parts of the imago may be seen enveloped in a very delicate,
  transparent skin.</p>

  <p>In Brazil <i>Dielocerus ellisii</i>, a sawfly allied to <i>Hylotoma</i>, constructs a nest in
  which the cocoons of many specimens are crowded together, being packed side by side like the cells
  in the comb of the bee, while the whole mass is protected by a thick outer wall. It is not known
  in what manner this communal work is carried out, but it is interesting to note that the cocoons
  assume to a considerable extent the hexagonal form of the cells in the comb of the bee. Some doubt
  was expressed as to the interpretation put on this structure by Curtis, but his observations have
  been confirmed by Smith and Peckholt.</p>

  <p>Several species of sawflies are known to be very injurious to crops. One of these&mdash;the
  sawfly of the turnip, <i>Athalia spinarum</i> (<i>centifoliae</i> Panz.)&mdash;sometimes commits
  excessive depredations on the turnip crops in this country as well as on the continent of Europe;
  its life-history and anatomy were described by Newport <span class="pagenum" id="page516"><span
  class="smaller">{516}</span></span>in an essay published by the Entomological Society in 1838. The
  eggs, it appears, are laid singly at the edges of the leaves in the month of May, as many as 200
  or 300 being deposited by one female; as the parent flies are usually gregarious, appearing in
  large numbers in fields of turnips, it is not difficult to form an idea of the serious nature of
  their depredations. The egg grows very considerably; the development of the embryo is rapid,
  occupying, even in unfavourable weather, only seven or eight days, while in quite congenial
  circumstances it is probable that the eggs may hatch about the fourth day after their deposition.
  The young grub immediately begins to feed, and in about five days changes its skin for the first
  time; it repeats this operation twice at similar or slightly longer intervals, the third moult
  thus occurring when the larva is three or four weeks old; it is then that the larva begins to be
  most destructive. Sunshine and warm weather are very favourable to it, and under their influence
  it grows so rapidly that in a few days a field may be almost completely stripped of its foliage.
  This larva is of a sooty black colour, and will live on other Cruciferous plants quite as well as
  on the turnip. When full grown it buries itself to a slight depth under the surface of the earth,
  and forms an oval cocoon of a firm texture, and with many particles of earth closely adherent to
  it. The perfect fly emerges towards the end of July, and a second brood will be produced in the
  same season if circumstances are favourable; in that case the resulting larvae enter the ground
  for the formation of their cocoons in September or October, and pass the winter in their cocoons,
  but still in the larval state; changing to pupae in the following spring, and appearing as perfect
  Insects in May. From this account it appears not improbable that the offspring of a single female
  existing in the April of one year may amount by the following May&mdash;three generations having
  been passed through in the interval&mdash;to as many as 27,000,000 larvae. Fortunately the
  creatures are, as Frauenfeld observed, destroyed in very large numbers by a parasitic fungus and
  by a Nematode (<i>Filaria</i>).</p>

  <p>We have, earlier in the chapter, alluded to the fact that the phenomena of parthenogenesis
  prevail somewhat extensively among sawflies. It is the rule in the family that males are very much
  less numerous than females, and there are some species of which no males have been discovered.
  This would not be of <span class="pagenum" id="page517"><span
  class="smaller">{517}</span></span>itself certain evidence of the occurrence of parthenogenesis,
  but this has been placed beyond doubt by taking females bred in confinement, obtaining
  unfertilised eggs from them, and rearing the larvae produced from the eggs. This has been done by
  numerous observers with curious results. In many cases the parthenogenetic progeny, or a portion
  of it, dies without attaining full maturity. This may or may not be due to constitutional weakness
  arising from the parthenogenetic state. Cameron, who has made extensive observations on this
  subject, thinks that the parthenogenesis does involve constitutional weakness, fewer of the
  parthenogenetic young reaching maturity. This he suggests may be compensated for&mdash;when the
  parthenogenetic progeny is all of the female sex&mdash;by the fact that all those that grow up are
  producers of eggs. In many cases the parthenogenetic young of Tenthredinidae are of the male sex,
  and sometimes the abnormal progeny is of both sexes. In the case of one species&mdash;the common
  currant sawfly, <i>Nematus ribesii</i>&mdash;the parthenogenetic progeny is nearly, but not quite,
  always, entirely of the male sex; this has been ascertained again and again, and it is impossible
  in these cases to suggest any advantage to the species to compensate for constitutional
  parthenogenetic weakness. On the whole, it appears most probable that the parthenogenesis, and the
  special sex produced by it, whether male or female, are due to physiological conditions of which
  we know little, and that the species continue in spite of the parthenogenesis, rather than profit
  by it. It is worthy of remark that one of the species in which parthenogenesis with production of
  males occurs&mdash;<i>Nematus ribesii</i>&mdash;is perhaps the most abundant of sawflies.</p>

  <p>Although many kinds of Insects display the greatest solicitude and ingenuity in providing
  proper receptacles for their eggs, and in storing food for the young that will be produced, there
  are extremely few that display any further interest in their descendants; probably, indeed, the
  majority of Insects die before the eggs are hatched, one generation never seeing the individuals
  of another. It is therefore interesting to find that a fairly well authenticated case of maternal
  attachment, such as we have previously alluded to as occurring in earwigs, has been recorded in
  <i>Perga lewisii</i>, an Australian sawfly of the sub-family Cimbicides. The mother, having
  deposited about eighty eggs on the leaf of a Eucalyptus, remains with them until they hatch, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page518"><span class="smaller">{518}</span></span>after which she sits over
  her brood with outstretched legs, and with admirable perseverance protects them, so far as she is
  able, from the attacks of parasites and other enemies; she quite refuses to be driven away from
  her charges. Mr. Lewis, to whom we are indebted for this account,<a id="NtA_427"
  href="#Nt_427"><sup>[427]</sup></a> states that the sawfly does not recognise her own special
  brood, but will give equal attention to another brood if she be transferred thereto; and he adds
  that many of the batches of larvae were destitute of any maternal guardian.</p>

  <p class="sp5">There are about 2000 species of sawflies known. A large majority of them are found
  in the European and North American regions; still, a good many are known to live in South America,
  and <i>Perga</i>&mdash;one of the genera of the family containing many species of large
  size&mdash;is peculiar to the Australian region. Although the family includes so many species,
  very few anomalies of structure have been detected in it; one species, <i>Pompholyx dimorpha</i>
  Freymuth, is described as being apterous in the female, and as having the thorax curiously
  modified in its form. There are no very small Insects in the family, and none over the middle
  size. Nearly 400 species have been detected in Britain; this number could certainly be increased
  by persevering researches. The palaeontological record has hitherto given only a very meagre
  evidence about sawflies. Several species have been preserved in amber, and three or four are known
  from Tertiary strata in Europe and North America.</p>

  GALL-FLIES&ndash;PROCTOTRYPIDAE&ndash;CHALCIDIDAE&ndash;ICHNEUMONIDAE&ndash;BRACONIDAE&ndash;STEPHANIDAE&ndash;MEGALYRIDAE&ndash;EVANIIDAE&ndash;PELECINIDAE&ndash;TRIGONALIDAE.</span></p>

  <p>We now pass to the consideration of the Hymenoptera of the sub-Order Petiolata, or Apocrita, as
  they are styled by Brauer. We should make use of the term Petioliventres, for it contrasts
  naturally by its termination with Sessiliventres, were it not that the word is so uncouth that we
  think it better to adopt the shorter and more euphonious expression, Petiolata.</p>

  <p>The members of this sub-Order, without exception, have the hind body connected with the thorax
  by means of a deep constriction, so that the base of the abdomen (Fig. 336, B, <i>b</i>) is very
  narrow; the articulation between the two parts is effected by means of a complex joint allowing
  great play, and facilitating the operations of boring and stinging, processes that are of extreme
  importance in the economy of the great majority of the species. The petiole is sometimes extremely
  short, but it may be so long that it appears like a stalk, at whose extremity is borne the
  remaining part of the abdomen (Fig. 369). When the petiole is very short the abdomen reposes close
  to the back of the thorax (Fig. 331, C), and in this case the abdomen is usually described as
  sessile; while, when it is evidently stalked, it is said to be petiolate. These terms are,
  however, unsuitable, as the words sessile and petiolate should be reserved for the conditions
  characteristic of the two sub-Orders. We shall therefore use the terms pseudo-sessile and
  pedicellate for the two conditions of the Petiolata.</p>

  <p>The Hymenoptera Petiolata comprises an enormous majority <span class="pagenum"
  id="page520"><span class="smaller">{520}</span></span>of the Order. Although it includes many of
  the most interesting and important of Insects, its classification is but little advanced, for a
  great many of the forms are still rare or unknown. Three series may be adopted for the purposes of
  nomenclature.</p>

  <p>1. <i>Parasitica.</i>&mdash;Trochanters of two pieces, female with an ovipositor.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Tubulifera.</i>&mdash;Trochanters undivided; abdomen consisting of only three, four, or
  five visible segments.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Aculeata.</i>&mdash;Trochanters undivided; abdomen consisting of six or seven visible
  segments; female furnished with a retractile sting.</p>

  <p>In the absence of any clear distinction between sting and ovipositor, these groups are merely
  conventional. The character furnished by the trochanters is unfortunately subject to some
  exceptions, there being a few parasitic forms in which the trochanters are not divided, and a few
  aculeates in which the reverse is more or less distinctly the case; moreover, the division, when
  it exists, is in some cases obscure, and the two pieces are of unequal size. Ratzeburg calls the
  upper division, which is frequently much larger than the other, the trochanter, and the lower
  division the apophysis. There is much reason for believing that the apophysis is really merely a
  secondary division of the femur. The Tubulifera are a comparatively small group, and will probably
  be merged in one of the other two, when the anatomy and morphology of the abdomen have been more
  thoroughly elucidated.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Hymenoptera Parasitica or Terebrantia.</b></p>

  <p>This is one of the most extensive divisions of the class Insecta. There can be little doubt
  that it contains 200,000 species, and possibly the number may be very much greater than this. It
  is, however, one of the most neglected of the great groups of Insects, though it is perhaps of
  greater economic importance to mankind than any other.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page521"><span class="smaller">{521}</span></span></div>

  <p>Insects derive their sustenance primarily from the vegetable kingdom. So great and rapid are
  the powers of assimilation of the Insect, so prodigious its capacity for multiplication, that the
  Mammal would not be able to compete with it were it not that the great horde of six-legged
  creatures has divided itself into two armies, one of which destroys the other. The parasitic
  Hymenoptera are chiefly occupied in destroying the tribes of vegetarian Insects; the parasites do
  this by the simple and efficient device of dwelling in the bodies of their hosts and appropriating
  the nutriment the latter take in. The parasites do not, as a rule, eat the structures of their
  host,&mdash;many of them, indeed, have no organs that would enable them to do this,&mdash;but they
  absorb the vegetable juices that, in a more or less altered state, form the lymph or so-called
  blood of the host. The host could perhaps starve out his enemies by a judicious system of
  abstention from food; instead, however, of doing this, he adopts the suicidal policy of persistent
  eating, and as the result of his exertions, furnishes sufficient food to his parasites, and then
  dies himself, indirectly starved. Ratzeburg considers that the traditional view that the larvae of
  parasitic Hymenoptera live by eating the fat-body of their host is erroneous. They imbibe, he
  considers, the liquid that fills the body of the parasitised Insect.<a id="NtA_428"
  href="#Nt_428"><sup>[428]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The wide prevalence of Insect parasitism is appreciated only by entomologists. The destructive
  winter moth&mdash;<i>Cheimatobia brumata</i>&mdash;is known to be subject to the attacks of
  sixty-three species of Hymenopterous parasites. So abundant are these latter that late in the
  autumn it is not infrequently the case that the majority of caterpillars contain these destroyers.
  Although Lepidoptera are very favourite objects with parasitic Hymenoptera, yet other Insects are
  also pertinaciously attacked; there is quite a host of Insect creatures that obtain their
  sustenance by living inside the tiny Aphididae, or "green-flies," that so much annoy the gardener.
  A still larger number of parasites attack eggs of Insects, one or more individuals finding
  sufficient sustenance for growth and development inside another Insect's egg. As Insects have
  attacked Insects, so have parasites attacked parasites, and the phenomena called hyperparasitism
  have been developed. These cases of secondary parasitism, in which another <span class="pagenum"
  id="page522"><span class="smaller">{522}</span></span>species attacks a primary parasite, are
  extremely numerous. It is also pretty certain that tertiary parasitism occurs, and Riley is of
  opinion that even quaternary destruction is not outside the range of probability.</p>

  <p>The physiological problems connected with Insect parasitism are of great interest to the
  entomologist; the modes of nutrition and respiration of these encaged creatures could not fail to
  be most instructive were we fully acquainted with them. It is obvious that when an Insect-egg is
  laid inside another Insect's egg, and the parasite has to undergo the whole of its growth therein,
  it is in the strangest condition as regards nutrition. It is unnecessary for the intruded egg to
  have yolk of its own; moreover, the embryonic mode of nutrition may be continued during what
  would, with other Insects, be the larval period. And it seems to be the case that both these
  conditions are actually met with in the lives of egg-parasites. The embryology and post-embryonic
  development of parasitic Hymenoptera have already been ascertained to be of the most extraordinary
  nature. Great variety, however, will no doubt be found to exist, as will be readily understood if
  we tabulate the conditions of the early life of various parasitic Hymenoptera.</p>

  <p>1. The egg may be laid outside a larva, and the embryonic and larval developments may both be
  passed on the exterior.</p>

  <p>2. The egg may be laid and the embryonic development passed through, outside the host, but the
  parasite on hatching may enter the host, so that the post-embryonic development is passed in the
  lymph of the host.</p>

  <p>3. The egg may be laid inside the host, both embryonic and post-embryonic developments being
  gone through in the fluids of the host.</p>

  <p>4. The egg may be laid inside another egg, the embryonic and post-embryonic developments being
  passed therein.</p>

  <p>We shall find that all these conditions exist in the Insects we are about to consider.</p>

  <p class="sp3">We shall treat the series as composed of ten families; but we must remind the
  student that this great subject is still in a very unadvanced state; the combined efforts of
  generations of naturalists will be required to perfect it. Of the ten families five are
  comparatively insignificant in number of species. Many of the Cynipidae are not parasitic in
  habits, but live in galls. <span class="pagenum" id="page523"><span
  class="smaller">{523}</span></span>After what we have said as to the mode of nutrition of
  parasites it will be understood that the physiological conditions of life may not be so different
  in a gall-dweller and a parasite as would at first be supposed; and it is perhaps not a matter for
  much surprise that good characters cannot be found to separate the gallicolous from the parasitic
  forms.</p>

  <p>The Cynipidae are always small, frequently minute, Insects; usually black or pitchy in colour.
  The simple structure of the antennae and the number of their joints are of importance as an aid in
  identifying a Cynipid. The mesonotum is usually remarkably convex, and has, behind, a prominent
  scutellum, which more or less overhangs the small metanotum and the median segment; these are
  perpendicular in their direction; the sculpture of these posterior parts of the alitrunk is
  usually deep and remarkable. The abdomen has usually only a short petiole, so as to be
  pseudo-sessile; but there are some genera in which this part is rather long. The abdomen is
  generally so very much changed in outer form that its structure is not easily understood. The
  visible portion is frequently in larger part made up of the greatly enlarged dorsal plate of the
  second or third segment, or of both. These large plates are really chiefly composed of free flaps,
  and on lifting them up the large ventral plates are disclosed, although these appeared previously
  to be nearly or quite absent. In the female <span class="pagenum" id="page524"><span
  class="smaller">{524}</span></span>there is a very slender ovipositor, of which only a small part
  protrudes, although the organ is really elongate; it is drawn into the abdomen by means of a
  peculiar series of structures, the modified terminal segments to which it is attached being folded
  over into the interior of the body in such a way that the posterior part becomes situated
  anteriorly. In conformity with this arrangement, the ovipositor is bent double on itself, the
  anterior and the middle portions of the borer being carried into the body, leaving only a small
  part projecting beyond the extremity. The Cynipid ovipositor is an instrument of much delicacy,
  and is capable of a great deal of movement; it is usually serrate just at the tip, and although it
  looks so very different from the cutting apparatus of the sawflies (Fig. 344), it seems that it is
  really composed of pieces similar in their origin to those of the Tenthredinidae.</p>

  <p>The wings frequently bear fine hairs; the paucity of nervures and the absence of the "stigma"
  are of importance in the definition of the family. The most important of the cells is one called
  the radial cell, situate just beyond the middle of the front part of the wing.</p>

  <p>We cannot enter into a consideration of the classification of the family, as authorities are
  not agreed on the subject.<a id="NtA_429" href="#Nt_429"><sup>[429]</sup></a> As regards their
  habits Cynipidae are, however, of three different kinds: (1) the true gall-flies, or Psenides,
  which lay an egg or eggs in the tissues of a growing plant, in the interior of which the larva
  lives after it is hatched; this mode of life may or may not, according to the species, be
  accompanied by formation of a peculiar growth called a gall: (2) Inquilines,<a id="NtA_430"
  href="#Nt_430"><sup>[430]</sup></a> or guest-flies; <span class="pagenum" id="page525"><span
  class="smaller">{525}</span></span>these lay their eggs in the galls formed by the gall-makers
  subsequent to the growth of the galls, of which they obtain the benefit: (3) Parasites; these
  live, like most Ichneumon-flies, in the interior of the bodies of other living Insects; they prey
  on a considerable variety of Insects, but chiefly, it is believed, on Aphididae, or on Dipterous
  larvae. These parasitic flies belong to the sub-family Figitides.</p>

  <p>A great deal of discussion has occurred relative to the nature and origin of galls, and many
  points still remain obscure. Considerable light has been thrown on the subject by the direct
  observations of modern naturalists. Previous to Malpighi, who wrote on the subject two hundred
  years ago, it was supposed that galls were entirely vegetable productions, and that the maggots
  found in them were due to spontaneous generation, it having been an article of belief in the
  Middle Ages that maggots in general arose from the various organic substances in which they were
  found, by means of the hypothetical process called, as we have said, spontaneous generation.
  Malpighi was aware of the unsatisfactory nature of such a belief, and having found by observation
  that galls arose from the punctures of Insects, he came to the further conclusion that the growth
  of the gall was due to the injection by the Insect into the plant of a fluid he termed Ichor,
  which had, he considered, the effect of producing a swelling in the plant, something in the same
  way as the sting of a bee or wasp produces a swelling in an animal. R&eacute;aumur also made observations
  on the gall-Insects, and came to the conclusion that the latter part of Malpighi's views was
  erroneous, and that the swelling was not due to any fluid, but simply to irritation caused by the
  prick; this irritation being kept up by the egg that was deposited and by the subsequent
  development of the larva. Observations since the time of R&eacute;aumur have shown that the matter is not
  quite so simple as he supposed, for though in the case of some galls the development of the gall
  commences immediately after the introduction of the egg, yet in other cases, as in the Cynipidae,
  it does not occur till some time thereafter, being delayed even until after the hatching of the
  egg and the commencement of the development of the larva. Galls are originated <span
  class="pagenum" id="page526"><span class="smaller">{526}</span></span>by a great variety of
  Insects, as well as by mites, on many plants; and it must not be concluded that a gall has been
  formed by Hymenoptera even when these Insects are reared from one. Extremely curious galls are
  formed by scale-Insects of the sub-family Brachyscelides on Eucalyptus trees in Australia; they
  are much inhabited by parasitic Hymenoptera, and Froggatt has obtained 100 specimens of a small
  black Chalcid from a single dead Brachyscelid.<a id="NtA_431" href="#Nt_431"><sup>[431]</sup></a>
  The exact manner in which many of these galls originate is not yet sufficiently ascertained; but
  the subject of the galls resulting from the actions of Cynipidae has received special attention,
  and we are now able to form a conception of their nature. They are produced by the meristematic or
  dividing tissue of plants, and frequently in the cambium zone, which is caused to develop to an
  unusual extent, and in a more or less abnormal manner, by the presence of the Insect. The exact
  way in which a Cynipid affects the plant is perhaps not conclusively settled, and may be found to
  differ in the cases of different Cynipidae, but the view advocated by Adler and others, and
  recently stated by Riley,<a id="NtA_432" href="#Nt_432"><sup>[432]</sup></a> seems satisfactory;
  it is to the effect that the activity of the larva probably affects the meristem, by means of a
  secretion exuded by the larva. The mere presence of the egg does not suffice to give rise to the
  gall, for the egg may be deposited months before the gall begins to form. It is for the same
  reason improbable that a fluid injected by the parent fly determines the gall's growth. It is true
  that the parent fly does exude a liquid during the act of oviposition, but this is believed to be
  merely of a lubricant nature, and not to influence the development. It is said that the gall
  begins to form in some cases before the larva is actually hatched, but the eggs of some
  Hymenoptera exhibit remarkable phenomena of growth, so that the egg, even during development of
  the embryo in it, may in these cases, exert an influence on the meristem. It is to reactions
  between the physiological processes of the meristem and the growing Insect that the gall and its
  form are due.</p>

  <p>The investigations of several recent naturalists lend support to the view that only the
  meristematic cells of the plant can give rise to a gall. Riley says that the rate of growth of the
  gall is dependent on the activity of the meristem, galls on <span class="pagenum"
  id="page527"><span class="smaller">{527}</span></span>catkins developing the most quickly; those
  forming on young leaves also grow with rapidity, while galls formed on bark or roots may take
  months to attain their full size.</p>

  <p>It is a curious fact that Cynipid galls are formed chiefly on oaks, this kind of tree supplying
  a surprising number and variety of galls. The plants that furnish Cynipid galls in Europe are not
  numerous. A list of them is given by Cameron.<a id="NtA_433" href="#Nt_433"><sup>[433]</sup></a>
  Several species, of the genus <i>Rhodites</i>, attack rose-bushes. One of the best known of our
  British galls is the bedeguar, found in various parts of the country on both wild and cultivated
  rose-bushes (Fig. 348), and caused by <i>Rhodites rosae</i> (Fig. 349). This gall has the
  appearance of arising from a twig or stem, but it is really a leaf gall. Pazlavsky<a id="NtA_434"
  href="#Nt_434"><sup>[434]</sup></a> has described the mode of formation of the bedeguar. The
  female <i>Rhodites</i> in the spring selects a rose-bud&mdash;not a flower-bud&mdash;that should
  produce a twig and leaves, and pricks this bud in a systematic manner in three places. The three
  spots of the bud pricked by the Insect are the three undeveloped leaves that correspond to a
  complete cycle in the phyllotaxis of the plant. The three rudiments do not develop into leaves,
  but by a changed mode of growth give rise to the bedeguar. Usually this gall, as shown in our
  figure, is of large size, and contains numerous cells; but abortive specimens are not infrequently
  met with; sometimes a small one is seated on a rose-leaf, and it is thought that these are due to
  a failure on the part of the Insect to complete the pricking operation. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page528"><span class="smaller">{528}</span></span>Cynipidae will not go through their
  gall-making operations except under natural conditions. Giraud<a id="NtA_435"
  href="#Nt_435"><sup>[435]</sup></a> attempted to obtain oviposition, on gathered twigs of oak,
  from flies in confinement; but, although he experimented with thousands of specimens, they on no
  occasion laid their eggs in the fresh shoots placed at their disposal, but discharged their eggs
  in little heaps, without attention to the twigs. The same observer has also called attention to
  the fact that after being deposited in a bud the eggs of certain species of <i>Cynips</i> will
  remain dormant without producing, so far as can be seen, any effect on the tree for a period of
  fully ten months, but when the bud begins to develop and the egg hatches then the gall grows.</p>

  <p>The exact mode in which the egg is brought to the requisite spot in the plant is still
  uncertain. The path traversed by the ovipositor in the plant is sometimes of considerable length,
  and far from straight; in some cases before it actually pierces the tissues, the organ is thrust
  between scales or through fissures, so that the terebra, or boring part of the ovipositor, when it
  reaches the minute seam of cambium, is variously curved and flexed. Now as the canal in its
  interior is of extreme tenuity, and frequently of great length, it must be a very difficult matter
  for the egg to reach the tissue where it should develop. The eggs of Cynipidae are very remarkable
  bodies; they are very ductile, and consist of a head, and of a stalk that in some cases is five or
  six times as long as the head, and is itself somewhat enlarged at the opposite end. Some other
  Hymenoptera have also stalked eggs of a similar kind (Fig. 357, A, egg of <i>Leucospis</i>). It
  has been thought that this remarkable shape permits of the contents of the egg being transferred
  for a time to the narrower parts, and thus allows the broader portion of the egg to be temporarily
  compressed, and the whole structure to be passed through a very narrow canal or orifice. It is,
  however, very doubtful whether <span class="pagenum" id="page529"><span
  class="smaller">{529}</span></span>the egg really passes along the canal of the borer. Hartig
  thought that it did so, and Riley supports this view to a limited extent. Adler, however, is of a
  different opinion, and considers that the egg travels in larger part outside the terebra. It
  should be remembered that the ovipositor is really composed of several appendages that are
  developed from the outside of the body; thus the external orifice of the body is morphologically
  at the base of the borer, the several parts of which are in longitudinal apposition. Hence there
  is nothing that would render the view of the egg leaving the ovipositor at the base improbable,
  and Adler supposes that it actually does so, the thin end being retained between the divisions of
  the terebra. Riley is of opinion that the act of oviposition in these Insects follows no uniform
  system. He has observed that in the case of <i>Callirhytis clavula</i>, ovipositing in the buds of
  <i>Quercus alba</i>, the eggs are inserted by the egg-stalk into the substance of the leaf, and
  that the egg-fluids are at first gathered in the posterior end, which is not inserted. "The fluids
  are then gradually absorbed from this exposed portion into the inserted portion of the egg, and by
  the time the young leaves have formed the exposed [parts of the] shells are empty, the thread-like
  stalk has disappeared, and the egg-contents are all contained within the leaf tissue." He has also
  observed that in <i>Biorhiza nigra</i> the pedicel, or stalk, only is inserted in the embryonic
  leaf-tissue, and that the enlarged portion or egg-body is at first external. The same naturalist
  also records that in the case of a small inquiline species, <i>Ceroptres politus</i>, the pedicel
  of the egg is very short, and in this case the egg is thrust down into the puncture made by the
  borer, so that the egg is entirely covered.</p>

  <p>Some Cynipidae bore a large number of the channels for their eggs before depositing any of the
  latter, and it would appear that it is the rule that the boring of the channel is an act separate
  from that of actual oviposition. Adler distinguishes three stages: (1) boring of the canal; (2)
  the passage of the egg from the base of the ovipositor, where the egg-stalk is pinched between the
  two spiculae and the egg is pushed along the ovipositor; (3) after the point of the ovipositor is
  withdrawn, the egg-body enters the pierced canal, and is pushed forward by the ovipositor until it
  reaches the bottom.<a id="NtA_436" href="#Nt_436"><sup>[436]</sup></a></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page530"><span class="smaller">{530}</span></span></div>

  <p>About fifty years ago Hartig reared large numbers of certain species of gall-flies from their
  galls, obtaining from 28,000 galls of <i>Cynips disticha</i> about 10,000 flies, and from galls of
  <i>C. folii</i> 3000 or 4000 examples of this species; he found that all the individuals were
  females. His observations were subsequently abundantly confirmed by other naturalists, among whom
  we may mention Frederick Smith in our own country, who made in vain repeated attempts to obtain
  males of the species of the genus <i>Cynips</i>. On one occasion he collected in the South of
  England 4410 galls of <i>C. kollari</i> (at that time called <i>C. lignicola</i>), and from these
  he obtained 1562 flies, all of which were females. A second effort was attended with similar
  results. Hartig, writing in 1843, after many years' experience, stated that though he was
  acquainted with twenty-eight species of the genus <i>Cynips</i>, he had not seen a male of any one
  of them. During the course of these futile attempts it was, however, seen that a possible source
  of fallacy existed in the fact that the Insects were reared from collected galls; and these being
  similar to one another, it was possible that the males might inhabit some different gall. Adler
  endeavoured to put the questions thus raised to the test by means of rearing females from galls,
  and then getting these females to produce, parthenogenetically, galls on small oaks planted in
  pots, and thus completely under control. He was quite successful in carrying out his project, and
  in doing so he made a most extraordinary discovery, viz. that the galls produced by these
  parthenogenetic females on his potted oaks, were quite different from the galls from which the
  flies themselves were reared, and were, in fact, galls that gave rise to a fly that had been
  previously considered a distinct species; and of this form both sexes were produced. Adler's
  observations have been confirmed by other naturalists, and thus the occurrence of alternation of
  generations, one of the two generations being parthenogenetic, has been thoroughly established in
  Cynipidae. We may mention one case as illustrative. A gall-fly called <i>Chilaspis lowii</i> is
  produced from galls on oak-leaves at Vienna at the end of April, both sexes occurring. The female
  thereafter lays eggs on the ribs of the leaves of the same kind of oak, and thus produces a
  different gall from that which nourished herself. These galls fall off with the leaves in the
  autumn, and in July or August of the following year a gall-fly is produced from them. It is a
  different creature from the <span class="pagenum" id="page531"><span
  class="smaller">{531}</span></span>mother, and was previously known to entomologists under the
  name of <i>Chilaspis nitida</i>. Only females of it occur, and these parthenogenetic individuals
  lay their eggs in the young buds of the oak that are already present in the autumn, and in the
  following spring, when the buds open and the leaves develop, those that have had an egg laid in
  them produce a gall from which <i>Chilaspis lowii</i> emerges in April or May. In this case
  therefore the cycle of the two generations extends over two years, the generation that takes the
  greater part of the time for its production consisting only of females. Adler's observations
  showed that, though in some species this alternation of generations was accompanied by
  parthenogenesis in one part of the cycle, yet in other species this was not the case. He found,
  for instance, that some gall-flies of the genus <i>Aphilothrix</i> produced a series of
  generations the individuals of which were similar to one another, and were all females and
  parthenogenetic. In some species of the old genus <i>Cynips</i> no males are even yet known to
  occur. A very curious observation was made by the American, Walsh, viz. that of galls gathered by
  him quite similar to one another, some produced speedily a number of both sexes of <i>Cynips
  spongifica</i>, while much later on in the season the remainder of the galls gave rise to females
  only of an Insect called <i>Cynips aciculata</i>. It is believed that the galls gathered by
  Walsh<a id="NtA_437" href="#Nt_437"><sup>[437]</sup></a> were really all one species; so that
  parts of the same generation emerge at different times and in two distinct forms, one of them
  parthenogenetic, the other consisting of two sexes. It has, however, been suggested that <i>Cynips
  spongifica</i> and <i>C. aciculata</i> may be two distinct species, producing quite similar
  galls.</p>

  <p>Turning now to the questions connected with inquiline or guest-flies, we may commence with
  drawing attention to the great practical difficulties that surround the investigation of this
  subject. If we open a number of specimens of any kind of gall it is probable that several kinds of
  larvae will be found. In Fig. 350 we represent four kinds of larvae that were taken out of a few
  bedeguar galls gathered on one day in a lane near Cambridge. It is pretty certain that No. 1 in
  this figure represents the larva of <i>Rhodites rosae</i>, and that Nos. 2 and 3 are larvae of
  inquilines, possibly of <i>Synergus</i>, or of a parasite; while No. 4, which was engaged in
  feeding on No. 3 in the position <span class="pagenum" id="page532"><span
  class="smaller">{532}</span></span>shown, is possibly a Chalcid of the genus
  <i>Monodontomerus</i>, or may be <i>Callimome bedeguaris</i>. It is clear that, as we cannot
  ascertain what is inside a gall without opening it, and thereby killing the tenants, it is a most
  difficult matter to identify the larvae; the only safe method is that of observation of the act of
  oviposition; this may be supplemented by rearing the flies from galls, so as to ascertain what
  variety of flies are associated with each kind of gall. This last point has been well attended to;
  but the number of cases in which oviposition of inquiline gall-flies in the galls formed by the
  Psenides has been ascertained by direct observation is still very small; they are, however,
  sufficient to show that the inquilines deposit their eggs only after the galls are formed.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Bassett recorded the first case of the kind in connexion with a North American species,
  <i>Cynips</i> (<i>Ceroptres</i>) <i>quercus-arbos</i> Fitch. He says: "On the first of June galls
  on <i>Quercus ilicifolia</i> had reached their full size, but were still tender, quite like the
  young shoots of which they formed part. Examining them on that day, I discovered on them two
  gall-flies, which I succeeded in taking. They were females, and the ovipositor of each was
  inserted into the gall so deeply that they could not readily free themselves, and they were
  removed by force."</p>

  <p>The great resemblance of the inquiline gall-fly to the fly that makes the gall both dwell in,
  has been several times noticed by Osten Sacken, who says "one of the most curious circumstances
  connected with the history of two North American blackberry galls is, that besides the
  <i>Diastrophus</i>, which apparently is the genuine originator of the gall, they produce another
  gall-fly, no doubt an inquiline, belonging to the genus <i>Aulax</i>, and showing the most
  striking resemblance in size, colouring, and sculpture to the <i>Diastrophus</i>, their companion.
  The one is the very counterpart <span class="pagenum" id="page533"><span
  class="smaller">{533}</span></span>of the other, hardly showing any differences, except the
  strictly generic characters! This seems to be one of those curious instances, so frequent in
  entomology, of the resemblance between parasites and their hosts! By rearing a considerable number
  of galls of <i>D. nebulosus</i> I obtained this species as well as its parasite almost in equal
  numbers. By cutting some of the galls open I ascertained that a single specimen of the gall
  frequently contained both species, thus setting aside a possible doubt whether these Insects are
  not produced by two different, although closely similar galls."<a id="NtA_438"
  href="#Nt_438"><sup>[438]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The substance of which galls are composed, or rather, perhaps, a juice they afford, is
  apparently a most suitable pabulum for the support of Insect life, and is eagerly sought after by
  a variety of Insects; hence by collecting galls in large quantities many species of Insects may be
  reared from them; indeed by this means as many as thirty different kinds of Insects, and belonging
  to all, or nearly all, the Orders, have been obtained from a single species of gall. Some galls
  are sought by birds, which open them and extract their tenants, even in cases where it might be
  supposed that the nauseous flavour of the galls would forbid such proceedings.</p>

  <p>Not more than 500 species of Psenides and Inquiline Cynipidae are known from all parts of the
  world; and of described Parasitic Cynipidae there are only about 150 species. The British forms
  have recently been treated by Cameron in the work we have already several times referred to.<a

  <p>The Proctotrypidae is one of the most difficult groups of Hymenoptera to define; some of its
  members exhibit a great resemblance to Aculeate Hymenoptera. This is the case with the Insect we
  figure (Fig. 351). It, however, is an undoubted Proctotrypid, but there are other forms that
  approach very closely in appearance to the Aculeata, or stinging Hymenoptera; so that until a
  better comprehension is reached as to the distinction between a sting and an ovipositor the
  separation between Proctotrypidae and Aculeata must be considered somewhat arbitrary.</p>

  <p>There is extreme variety in the family; the wings differ considerably in shape and neuration;
  they are not infrequently altogether absent in one or both sexes. The chief distinction of the
  family from other parasitic Hymenoptera is the tubular form of the ovipositor; which part appears
  to be a continuation of the tip of the body. This latter is more definitely acuminate than usual,
  and has given rise to the term Oxyura, by which name the Proctotrypidae are distinguished in many
  books. From the Chalcididae they are distinguished also by the angles of the pronotum attaining
  the tegulae. In this character they agree with the Cynipidae, but the ovipositor and abdomen are
  very different in form in these two groups, and the Proctotrypidae very frequently have a
  pigmented spot or stigma on the front wings which is absent in Cynipidae. As if to add to the
  difficulties the systematist meets with in dealing with this family, some of its members have the
  trochanters undivided, as in the case of the stinging Hymenoptera. The larvae of all that are
  known lead a completely parasitic life in the bodies or eggs of other Insects or of Spiders.
  Sometimes half a dozen specimens may find the means of subsistence during the whole of their
  development in a single Insect's egg. Usually Proctotrypids pupate in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page535"><span class="smaller">{535}</span></span>the position in which they have fed up,
  enclosed each one in a more or less distinct cocoon. In Fig. 352 we represent a very remarkable
  case of Proctotrypid pupation; a larva of some beetle has nourished many specimens of a species of
  the genus <i>Proctotrypes</i>, and the pupae thereof project from the body of the host, a pair of
  the parasites issuing from each segmental division in a remarkably symmetrical manner.</p>

  <p>Comparatively little is known as to the habits of the members of this family, but such
  information as has been obtained leads to the conclusion that great variety will be found to exist
  in this respect. We have already mentioned that numerous species have been ascertained to feed
  inside the eggs of Insects or of Spiders; others have been reared from larvae or from galls of the
  minute Dipterous midges of the family Cecidomyiidae; others have been obtained from Cynipid galls,
  a few from ants' nests and from green-fly; some species are known to attack Coleoptera. The
  distinguished Irish entomologist, Haliday, has written an account of the proceedings of a species
  of <i>Bethylus</i>,<a id="NtA_440" href="#Nt_440"><sup>[440]</sup></a> from which it has been
  supposed that this Insect carries off living caterpillars, and stores them in a suitable
  receptacle as food for its progeny, thus anticipating, as it were, the habits of the fossorial
  division of the Aculeata, in which group this instinct has, as we shall subsequently relate,
  attained an astonishing degree of perfection. Haliday's observation was unfortunately incomplete
  and has not been subsequently confirmed. The Bethylides are remarkable for their great approach in
  structure to the Aculeates, so much so that entomologists are not agreed as to whether certain
  Insects are Proctotrypids or Aculeates. <i>Pristocera</i>, with a very wide distribution, may be
  mentioned as illustrative of these doubtful forms; but other genera of the Bethylides are in many
  respects very similar to the Aculeates, and it is not matter for surprise that Haliday should have
  considered the Bethylides to be a tribe of the stinging Hymenoptera. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page536"><span class="smaller">{536}</span></span>The genus <i>Scleroderma</i> consists of
  small Insects much resembling ants, and, as well as some of its allies, is of great interest from
  the remarkable phenomena of polymorphism presented by certain species. The males in this genus are
  winged, the females completely apterous; yet at times winged females are produced&mdash;as
  exceptional individuals in a brood of wingless specimens&mdash;the females in these cases being
  not only winged, but possessed of ocelli like the females of other winged Hymenoptera. Particulars
  of a case of this kind have been given by Sir Sidney Saunders,<a id="NtA_441"
  href="#Nt_441"><sup>[441]</sup></a> and Ashmead also mentions<a id="NtA_442"
  href="#Nt_442"><sup>[442]</sup></a> the exceptional occurrence of these winged females. Westwood<a
  id="NtA_443" href="#Nt_443"><sup>[443]</sup></a> was of opinion that there are three forms of the
  female sex. This subject is of importance in connexion with the production of the various castes
  in ants. Although the presence of wings in these Insects is always accompanied by the existence of
  ocelli (which, it will be remembered, are normally absent from the wingless individuals), yet the
  converse is not always the case, for a form of the female of <i>Cephalonomia formiciformis</i>,
  without any wings, yet having ocelli, as well as eyes, well developed, is figured by Westwood.<a

  </div>

  <p>The development of some of the Proctotrypids has been partially described by Ganin and others,
  and is of an extraordinary character. Ganin's observations<a id="NtA_445"
  href="#Nt_445"><sup>[445]</sup></a> were most complete in the case of a species of
  <i>Platygaster</i>, which he found in the larva of a very minute Dipteron of the genus
  <i>Cecidomyia</i>. The <i>Platygaster</i> larva changes its form very much in the course of its
  life, resembling at first a minute Crustacean rather than an Insect-larva; it has a very large
  rounded anterior portion, while behind it terminates in two, or more, tail-like processes. By a
  <span class="pagenum" id="page537"><span class="smaller">{537}</span></span>very peculiar kind of
  metamorphosis this <i>Cyclops</i>-like larva changes into an almost unsegmented, oviform larva,
  destitute of appendages; by a second change this creature assumes a third condition, in which it
  is similar to the ordinary form of parasitic Hymenopterous larvae. Sometimes several of the
  <i>Platygaster</i> larvae are found in a single host, but only one of them reaches this third
  stage. Afterwards the third larval instar passes into the pupal stage, which lasts five or six
  days, and then the perfect Insect appears. It is worthy of remark that the internal organs undergo
  quite as remarkable a change as the outer form does. The metamorphoses of some other
  Proctotrypidae have been examined by Ganin, and appear to be of an equally interesting
  character.<a id="NtA_446" href="#Nt_446"><sup>[446]</sup></a></p>

  <p>There is reason to suppose that these <i>Platygaster</i> parasites are of great economic
  importance as well as of scientific interest, for <i>Platygaster herrickii</i> is one of the
  enemies of the larva of the destructive Hessian fly, <i>Cecidomyia destructor</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Proctotrypidae</i> are no doubt extremely numerous in species, but as yet they have been
  very little studied; a good work on the British species is much required. A valuable contribution
  has recently been made to the study of the family by Ashmead, in the book we have already referred
  to. This volume includes much information on the natural history of these Insects, and the outline
  figures give some idea of the great variety of external form.</p>

  <p>Many entomologists include the Mymarides in Proctotrypidae, but Ashmead considers that they
  should be treated as a separate family. <i>Alaptus excisus</i> Westw. (Fig. 354) has been
  frequently said to be the smallest known Insect, the <span class="pagenum" id="page538"><span
  class="smaller">{538}</span></span>measurement given for it by Westwood<a id="NtA_447"
  href="#Nt_447"><sup>[447]</sup></a> being a length of &#x2159; of a millimetre&mdash;about <span
  class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">150</span> of an inch. Mr. Enock has recently
  examined Westwood's type in the Museum at Oxford, and from his information we may conclude that
  this Insect is probably the same as <i>Alaptus fusculus</i> Hal., and that the measurement
  mentioned by Westwood is erroneous, the Insect being really about half a millimetre long. The
  Mymarides are, however, very minute, some of them not exceeding one-third of a millimetre in
  length. Whether any of them are smaller than the beetles of the family Trichopterygidae, some of
  which are only one-fourth of a millimetre long, may be doubted.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Mymarides are recognisable by their very minute size, and by their peculiar
  wings. These are slender, destitute of nervures, fringed with long, delicate hairs, and stalked at
  the base. Probably Mymarides may all prove to be dwellers in eggs of other Insects. The group is
  remarkable from the fact that it contains some of the very few Hymenoptera with aquatic habits.
  Two species were discovered in their winged condition in the water of a pond near London by Sir
  John Lubbock<a id="NtA_448" href="#Nt_448"><sup>[448]</sup></a>; one of them&mdash;<i>Polynema
  natans</i> Lubbock&mdash;probably, according to Mr. Enock, the same as <i>Caraphractus cinctus</i>
  Hal., uses its wings freely for swimming under water, while the other&mdash;<i>Prestwichia
  aquatica</i>&mdash;performs this operation by the aid of its legs. This latter Insect seems to be
  very anomalous, and its position quite doubtful. The embryogeny of <i>Polynema</i> is very
  peculiar, and takes place in the egg of a dragon-fly&mdash;<i>Calepteryx virgo</i>&mdash;under
  water. According to Ganin,<a id="NtA_449" href="#Nt_449"><sup>[449]</sup></a> in the earliest
  stages the developments of the embryos of the <i>Calepteryx</i> and of the <i>Polynema</i>
  progress simultaneously, but that of the dragon-fly does not proceed beyond the formation of the
  ventral plate. The <i>Polynema</i> appears to leave its own egg at an extremely early stage of the
  embryonic development. It would appear, in fact, that there is no definite distinction between
  embryonic and larval stages. The information given by Ganin leads to the conclusion that a
  complete study of this remarkable mode of development is necessary before forming any general
  ideas as to the nature of Insect embryogeny and metamorphosis.</p>

  <p>The Insects of this family&mdash;the Pteromalini of Ratzeburg&mdash;are frequently of brilliant
  colours and of remarkable form; the species are very numerous, some 4000 or more having already
  been described. Of this number nearly 3000 are European, and as there is good reason for supposing
  that Chalcididae are quite as numerous in the Tropics and in the New World as they are in Europe,
  the family will probably prove to be one of the largest in the class. About twenty sub-families
  have already been proposed for the classification of the group; they are based chiefly on the
  number of joints in the tarsi, and the details of the antennae and of the ovipositor. This latter
  exhibits great variety in external appearance, due chiefly to the modification in form of the
  basal, or of the following ventral abdominal plates, one or more of which may be prolonged and
  altered in form or direction, giving rise in this way to considerable diversity in the shape of
  the abdomen. Correlative with this is a great variety in the mode of parasitism of the larva. Many
  live in galls, feeding on the larvae of the makers of the galls or on those of the inquilines;
  others attack caterpillars, others pupae only; some flourish at the expense of bees or other
  Hymenoptera, or of Coccidae <span class="pagenum" id="page540"><span

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The career of <i>Leucospis gigas</i> has been investigated by Fabre, and exhibits a very
  remarkable form of hypermetamorphosis.<a id="NtA_450" href="#Nt_450"><sup>[450]</sup></a> This
  Insect is of comparatively large size and of vivid colours, wasp-like, black contrasting with
  yellow, as in the case of the wasps; and like these it has the wings folded or doubled. The female
  bears a long ovipositor, which by a peculiar modification is packed in a groove on the back of the
  Insect. This species lives in Southern Europe at the expense of <i>Chalicodoma muraria</i>, a
  mason-bee that forms cells of a hard cement for its nest, the cells being placed together in
  masses of considerable size; each cell contains, or rather should contain, a larva of the bee, and
  is closed by masonry, in the construction of which the bee displays much ability. It is the
  mission of the <i>Leucospis</i> to penetrate the masonry by means of its ovipositor, and to
  deposit an egg in the cell of the bee. The period chosen for this predatory attack is the end of
  July or the beginning of August, at which time the bee-larva is in the torpid and powerless
  condition that precedes its assumption of the pupal state. The <i>Leucospis</i>, walking about
  leisurely and circumspectly on the masonry of the nest, tests it repeatedly by touching with the
  tips of the antennae, for it is most important that a proper spot should be selected. The bee's
  cell is placed in a mass of solid masonry, a considerable part&mdash;but a part only&mdash;of
  whose area is occupied by the group of cells; every cell is closed by hard mortar, making an
  uneven surface, and the face of the masonry is rendered more even by a layer of hardened clay
  outside the rougher material; it is the task of the <i>Leucospis</i> to detect a suitable spot, in
  the apparently uniform external covering, and there to effect the penetration so as to introduce
  an egg into a cell. By what sensations the fly may be guided is unknown. After a spot has been
  selected and the ovipositor brought into play, the masonry is ultimately pierced <span
  class="pagenum" id="page541"><span class="smaller">{541}</span></span>by patient work; sometimes a
  quarter of an hour is sufficient for the purpose, but in other cases three hours of uninterrupted
  effort are required before the end is attained. Fabre expended much time in watching this
  operation, and after the Insect had completed it, he marked with a pencil the exact spot of the
  masonry that was penetrated, and the date on which it was done, and he states that he afterwards
  found that without any exception a proper spot had been selected, and a cell consequently
  penetrated. Admirable as the instinct of the parasite appears from this point of view, it is
  nevertheless accompanied by a remarkable deficiency in two other respects. The first is that
  though the spot selected by the <i>Leucospis</i> invariably gives entrance to a cell, yet in the
  majority of the cases the selected cell is not a suitable one; a large number of the cells of the
  <i>Chalicodoma</i> are not occupied by living larvae on the point of pupation&mdash;though in that
  case only can the egg of the <i>Leucospis</i> hatch and successfully develop&mdash;but by dead and
  shrivelled larvae, or by mouldy or dried-up food. And yet, in each case of penetration, Fabre
  believes that an egg is deposited, even though it may be impossible that it can undergo a
  successful development. Strange as this may appear, it is nevertheless rendered less improbable by
  the second deficiency in the instinct of the parasite. The Insect has no power of recognising a
  cell that has been previously pierced either by itself or by another of its species. One bee larva
  can only supply nourishment for a single larva of the parasite, and yet it is a common occurrence
  for a cell to be revisited, pierced again and another egg introduced; indeed Fabre, by means of
  the cells he had marked, was able to assure himself that it is no uncommon thing for this to be
  done four times; four eggs, in fact, are sometimes deposited in a cell that cannot by any
  possibility supply food for more than one larva. The egg of the <i>Leucospis</i> is a curious
  object (Fig. 357, A), very elongate oval, with one end drawn out and bent so as to form a hook; it
  is not placed at random in the cell of the bee, but is suspended on the delicate cocoon with which
  the <i>Chalicodoma</i> larva is surrounded at the period of pupation.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Fabre allowed sufficient time to elapse for the hatching of the larvae from the eggs, and then
  opened some cells where Leucospis eggs had been deposited, in order to obtain the larvae; when
  doing this he was surprised that he never found more than one <i>Leucospis</i> larva in a cell.
  Even in cells where he had observed more than one act of oviposition, and which he had marked at
  the time, only one larva existed. This induced him to think that it was possible that no egg was
  deposited by the <i>Leucospis</i> at the second penetration. He accordingly examined cells soon
  after the eggs were laid, and thus discovered some that contained more than one egg,&mdash;indeed
  in one cell he observed no less than five eggs suspended from the cocoon of the
  <i>Chalicodoma</i>; he was also able to demonstrate that eggs were actually deposited in some
  cells that contained no means of support for the larva. How then could these two facts be
  reconciled&mdash;four or five eggs deposited in a cell, only one larva present afterwards? It is
  of course impossible to observe the operations of a larva shrouded in the obscurity of a cell
  formed of masonry, so he transferred some bee larvae with their destructive companions to glass
  tubes, in which he was able to note what took place. He found that the egg deposited by the
  <i>Leucospis</i> hatches and produces a very peculiar larva, having little resemblance to the
  <i>Leucospis</i> larva that he had found eating the <i>Chalicodoma</i> larva. The primary larva
  (Fig. 357, B) of the <i>Leucospis</i> is an arched worm, moderately deeply segmented, a millimetre
  or a little more in length, with a remarkably large and abruptly-defined head. The body bears
  erect setae, the most remarkable of which are a pair on the ventral aspect of each of the
  segments, each of these ventral setae being borne on a small conical prominence. These prominences
  and setae serve as ambulatory organs, and are supplemented in their function by a protuberance at
  the posterior extremity. The little creature has considerable powers of locomotion; it moves,
  after the fashion of many other larvae, by contracting and arching the body so as to bring the
  posterior part nearer to the anterior; then fixing the hinder part, the anterior is extended and
  fixed, the posterior being again brought nearer to the front. The <i>Leucospis</i> larva when
  hatched does not at once attack the bee larva which is to be its future food, but every few hours
  makes excursions over its surface, and even explores the walls of the cell; returning, however,
  always to the cocoon for repose. The object of these <span class="pagenum" id="page543"><span
  class="smaller">{543}</span></span>excursions is, Fabre believes, to ascertain if another
  <i>Leucospis</i> egg has been laid in the cell, and in that case to destroy it. For the food, as
  we have said, being only enough for one larva, and the mother <i>Leucospis</i> frequently laying
  more than one egg in a cell, it is necessary that all the eggs except one should be destroyed.
  Fabre did not actually observe the act of destruction, but he found repeatedly in his glass tubes
  that the supernumerary eggs were destroyed, being, in fact, wounded by the mandibles of the
  first-hatched larva. After several days of this wandering life the tiny destroyer undergoes a
  first moult, changing its skin and appearing as a very different creature (Fig. 357, C); it is now
  completely destitute of any means of locomotion, very deeply segmented, curved at one extremity,
  with a very small head, bearing extremely minute, scarcely perceptible, mandibles. The sole object
  of its existence in this state is to extract the contents of the <i>Chalicodoma</i> larva, and
  appropriate this material to the purposes of its own organisation. This it accomplishes not by
  wounding, tearing, or destroying the larva, for that apparently would not answer the purpose; the
  contents must be conveyed while still in their vital state to itself; and this it effects by
  applying its mouth to the extremely delicate skin of the victim, the contents of whose body then
  gradually pass to the destroyer, without any visible destruction of the continuity of the
  integument. Thus the <i>Leucospis</i> larva gradually grows, while the bee larva shrinks and
  shrivels, without, however, actually suffering death. The process of emptying the bee larva
  apparently does not occupy the <i>Leucospis</i> more than two or three weeks, being completed by
  about the middle of the month of August; afterwards the larva remains in the cell by the side of
  the shrivelled skin of its victim for ten or eleven months, at the end of which time it assumes
  the pupal condition, and very shortly thereafter appears as a perfect Insect.</p>

  <p><i>Monodontomerus cupreus</i> is another member of the Chalcididae that lives parasitically at
  the expense of bees of the genus <i>Chalicodoma</i>. Its habits have been sketched by Fabre,<a
  id="NtA_451" href="#Nt_451"><sup>[451]</sup></a> and exhibit considerable difference from those of
  <i>Leucospis</i>. It is much less in size, and can accommodate itself to a greater variety of
  food; it will, in fact, eat not only the larva of <i>Chalicodoma</i>, but also that of another
  bee, of the genus <i>Stelis</i>, that is frequently found <span class="pagenum" id="page544"><span
  class="smaller">{544}</span></span>shut up in the cell of the <i>Chalicodoma</i>, at whose expense
  the <i>Stelis</i> also lives parasitically. The <i>Monodontomerus</i> bores a hole through the
  masonry of the bee and deposits its eggs in the cell after the fashion of the <i>Leucospis</i>;
  one bee larva is, however, sufficient food for several individuals of the young of this smaller
  parasite. There is no hypermetamorphosis, the early larval condition resembling the later. This
  Insect attacks not only <i>Chalicodoma</i> and <i>Stelis</i>, as already mentioned, but also other
  bees; and a single larva of some of the larger kinds will afford sufficient food for fifty young
  of the <i>Monodontomerus</i>. They feed on the bee larva, as the <i>Leucospis</i> does, without
  wounding it. This fly has the power of recognising what is suitable provender for its young by the
  use of the antennae, even when the conditions are so changed that it is clear the sense of sight
  has nothing to do with the recognition. Fabre relates that he had extracted a number of the bee
  larvae from their cells of masonry, and that as they were lying on his table enclosed in their
  cocoons, the <i>Monodontomerus</i> recognised the latter as containing the desired provender for
  its young by examining them with its antennae; after which, without hesitation, the
  <i>Monodontomerus</i> pierced the cocoon with its ovipositor and deposited the eggs in a suitable
  position. This observation, together with those made on <i>Leucospis</i>, seem to indicate that it
  is neither by sight nor smell that these Insects discover the desired object, but by some sense we
  do not understand, though its seat is clearly in the antennae of the Insect.</p>

  <p>Newport discovered a <i>Monodontomerus</i>, which he described as <i>M. nitidus</i>,<a
  id="NtA_452" href="#Nt_452"><sup>[452]</sup></a> in the cells of the bee <i>Anthophora retusa</i>,
  and demonstrated that the alimentary canal, as is usual in Petiolate Hymenoptera, is closed behind
  until the Insect is about to enter the pupal state, when it becomes perforated and faecal matters
  are for the first time passed from it. "These matters were composed of the refuse of digestion and
  of epithelial cells accumulated during the period of feeding, and retained in the digestive sac
  until the period of its perforation. In this way the food and abode of the Insects are maintained
  pure and uncontaminated, and the digestive apparatus is completed, and the refuse of nutrition
  ejected only when the whole of the food has been consumed."</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page545"><span class="smaller">{545}</span></span></div>

  <p>In the cells of the same bee Newport discovered another curious parasitic Chalcid,
  <i>Anthophorabia retusa</i>.<a id="NtA_453" href="#Nt_453"><sup>[453]</sup></a> The male has short
  wings, and the compound eye is replaced by an ocellus on each side of the head, the female having
  fully developed wings and eyes. A variation may occur in the metamorphosis of this Insect,
  inasmuch as when the growth is completed during the month of August, the Insect changes to a pupa,
  the imago appears ten or twelve days thereafter, and the perfect Insect then hibernates for seven
  or eight months; but should the completion of growth be deferred till after the end of August,
  hibernation takes place in the larval condition. A large and brilliant Chalcid <i>Eucharis
  myrmeciae</i>, has been described by Cameron as preying on the formidable Australian ants of the
  genus <i>Myrmecia</i>.</p>

  <p>The development of <i>Smicra clavipes</i> has been partially described by Henneguy.<a
  id="NtA_454" href="#Nt_454"><sup>[454]</sup></a> This Insect lives in the interior of the aquatic
  larva of <i>Stratiomys strigosa</i>, a Dipterous Insect. As many as fifty eggs of the parasite are
  found in one larva, but a large number of embryos die during development, so that he has never
  found more than two or three well-grown larvae in one <i>Stratiomys</i> larva. It has been
  ascertained that the eggs of many of these parasitic Insects are deficient in yolk, and the ovum
  of <i>Smicra</i> is said to obtain the nutritive materials necessary for the development of the
  embryo from the blood of its host by endosmosis. For a long time after the assumption of the
  larval condition, the larva appears to nourish itself only at the expense of the blood of its
  host. The segmentation of the ovum is total, and a single embryonic membrane appears at an early
  period, before the formation of the embryo, by a process very different from that giving origin to
  the amnion of the majority of Insects.</p>

  <p>A very interesting sketch of the development of <i>Encyrtus fuscicollis</i> has been given by
  Bugnion.<a id="NtA_455" href="#Nt_455"><sup>[455]</sup></a> This small parasite passes its earlier
  stages in the interior of the larva of <i>Hyponomeuta cognatella</i> or other Lepidoptera. The
  female <i>Encyrtus</i> deposits her eggs in the interior of a caterpillar, in the form of a series
  of 50 to 100 or more eggs enclosed in a sac; the origin <span class="pagenum" id="page546"><span
  class="smaller">{546}</span></span>of the sac is obscure, but the embryonic development and the
  early part of the larval life are passed in the sac, which contains a supply of nutritive matter.
  The larvae of the <i>Encyrtus</i> are at first entirely confined to this sac, but when they have
  consumed all the nutritive matter in it, they leave it and pass the remainder of their larval and
  pupal existence in the body-cavity of the caterpillar. They live at first on the lymph (blood) of
  the Insect, and apparently do it no harm; nevertheless the strength of the caterpillar is so much
  enfeebled that it fails to undergo the transformation to a pupa; the parasites then devour its
  interior, and use the empty skin as a nidus for their own pupation; they form cocoons which divide
  the area into compartments. Usually the individuals disclosed from one <i>Hyponomeuta</i> are all
  of one sex, which may be either male or female. Unfortunately the most interesting points of this
  development, viz. the history of the common sac for the larvae, the nature of the eggs, the
  earlier embryonic stages, and the nutriment in the sac, are still without elucidation. The account
  given by Bugnion raises a great desire for information on these points.</p>

  <p>We have in a previous page described the remarkable mode of oviposition of <i>Mantis</i>.
  Captain Xambeu<a id="NtA_456" href="#Nt_456"><sup>[456]</sup></a> has made a very curious
  observation to the effect that a minute Chalcid, <i>Podagrion (Palmon) pachymerus</i>, shelters
  itself under the wings of the <i>Mantis</i> so as to be in a position to oviposit in the eggs of
  the latter when it shall be forming its peculiar ootheca.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Isosoma</i> consists of Insects that differ in habits from their congeners, being
  phytophagous instead of parasitic. <i>I. tritici</i> and <i>I. hordei</i> live in the stalks of
  corn, and in North America, where they are known to the agriculturist as joint-worms, are
  frequently very injurious to crops. They are sometimes obtained in large numbers without any males
  appearing, and a wingless as well as a winged form of the female occurs. Owing to the fact that
  the allies of these Insects are parasitic, it has been frequently maintained that this may also
  prove to be the case with <i>Isosoma</i>, but the observations of Riley<a id="NtA_457"
  href="#Nt_457"><sup>[457]</sup></a> and others leave no doubt that the Insects of this genus are
  really plant-feeders.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page547"><span class="smaller">{547}</span></span></div>

  <p>Riley has called attention<a id="NtA_458" href="#Nt_458"><sup>[458]</sup></a> to some facts in
  connection with <i>I. tritici</i> and <i>I. grande</i>, that make it clear that these two supposed
  species are really alternate generations, and that both generations are probably in larger part,
  if not entirely, parthenogenetic. Some species of the genus <i>Megastigmus</i> are known to be of
  phytophagous habits.<a id="NtA_459" href="#Nt_459"><sup>[459]</sup></a></p>

  </div>

  <p>The most interesting of all the forms of Chalcididae are perhaps those called fig-Insects. A
  considerable number of species are now known, and amongst them we meet with the unusual phenomenon
  of species with wingless males, the females possessing the organs of flight normally developed.
  The wingless males exhibit the strangest forms, and bear no resemblance whatever to their more
  legitimately formed partners (Fig. 358, A, B). Many of the fig-Insects belong to a special group
  called Agaonides. Others belong to the group Torymides, which contains likewise many Chalcididae
  of an ordinary kind; possibly some of these may be parasitic on the Agaonides. Some of these
  Torymid fig-Insects have winged males, as is normal in the family, but in other cases winged and
  wingless forms of the male of one species may be present.</p>

  <p>The most notorious of these fig-Insects is the one known as <i>Blastophaga grossorum</i> (Fig.
  358), this being the chief agent in the custom known as caprification of the cultivated fig-tree.
  This process has been practised from time immemorial, and is at the present day still carried on
  in Italy and the Grecian archipelago. The Greek writers who describe it say that the wild
  fig-tree, though it does not ripen its own fruit, is absolutely essential for the perfection of
  the fruit of the cultivated fig. In accordance with this view, branches from the wild fig <span
  class="pagenum" id="page548"><span class="smaller">{548}</span></span>are still gathered at
  certain seasons and suspended amongst the branches of the cultivated fig-trees. The young fig is a
  very remarkable vegetable production, consisting of a hollow, fleshy receptacle, in which are
  placed the extremely numerous and minute flowers, the only admission to which is by a small
  orifice at the blunt end of the young fig; this orifice is lined with projecting scales, that more
  or less completely fill it up or close it; nevertheless inside this fruit the <i>Blastophaga
  grossorum</i> develops in large numbers. The males are, as we have seen, wingless creatures, and
  do not leave the fruit in which they were bred, but the females make their way out of the wild
  fig, and some of them, it is believed, enter the young fruit of the cultivated trees and lay their
  eggs, or attempt to do so, therein; and it has been supposed by various writers that these
  proceedings are essential to the satisfactory development of the edible fruit. It is a curious
  fact that the <i>Blastophaga</i> develops very freely in the wild fig&mdash;so much so, indeed, as
  to be a means of preventing it from coming to maturity; but yet the Insect cannot complete its
  development in the cultivated fruit. This is due to the fact that the fly must lay its egg in a
  particular part of the fig-ovule, so that when the egg hatches the larva may have a proper supply
  of food. In the cultivated fig the structure of the flower differs somewhat from that of the
  caprificus, as the wild fig is called, and so the egg, if deposited at all, does not reach a
  proper nidus for its development. Hence the <i>Blastophaga</i> can never live exclusively on the
  cultivated fig, and if it be really necessary for the development of the latter, must be brought
  thereto by means of the caprifig. Whether the <i>Blastophaga</i> be really of use, as has been for
  so long supposed, is, however, a matter for doubt. The reasons for this are (1) that those who
  think caprification beneficial do not agree as to the mode in which they suppose it to be so; (2)
  that there is but little reason for believing that when introduced amongst the cultivated figs the
  <i>Blastophaga</i> occupies itself to any great extent therewith; and (3) that in some parts of
  the world caprification is not performed, but the cultivated fig nevertheless ripens its fruit
  there. Hence many writers on the subject&mdash;Solms-Laubach,<a id="NtA_460"
  href="#Nt_460"><sup>[460]</sup></a> Mayer,<a id="NtA_461" href="#Nt_461"><sup>[461]</sup></a> and
  Saunders<a id="NtA_462" href="#Nt_462"><sup>[462]</sup></a>&mdash;entertain considerable doubt as
  to whether caprification is at present anything <span class="pagenum" id="page549"><span
  class="smaller">{549}</span></span>more than an old custom destitute of practical utility. On the
  other hand, Riley states<a id="NtA_463" href="#Nt_463"><sup>[463]</sup></a> "that the perfect
  Smyrna fig, the most esteemed of the edible species, can be produced only by the intervention of
  the <i>Blastophaga psenes</i> [<i>grossorum</i>]."</p>

  <p>Although the questions connected with the effect the <i>Blastophaga</i> is supposed to produce
  on the fruit are of a botanical rather than a entomological nature, we may briefly say that two
  views have been held: (1) that, as in the fruit of the cultivated fig, only female flowers are
  produced, the <i>Blastophaga</i> is necessary for their fertilisation and the subsequent
  development of the fruit; (2) that the Insects stimulate the fig by biting parts thereof or by
  burrowing in it, and so give rise to the processes that have as their result the edible fruit.
  There seems to be little doubt that the Insect agency is necessary to the fertilisation of some
  species of figs. Cunningham, who has recently carried out an elaborate investigation as to the
  fertilisation of <i>Ficus roxburghii</i>,<a id="NtA_464" href="#Nt_464"><sup>[464]</sup></a>
  concludes that in this fig, and probably also in other kinds, the perfect development is dependent
  on the access of the fig-Insects to the interior of the receptacular cavity. Should access fail to
  occur, both male and female flowers abort, without the formation of pollen grains by the former or
  seeds by the latter. The access of the <i>Blastophaga</i> is thus as necessary for the perfect
  evolution of the normal male and female flowers as it is for that of the modified &#x2640; or
  gall-flowers, with their contained ova and Insect-embryos. Whether the successful fertilisation of
  the flowers is really essential to the production of the edible fig is not a question for our
  discussion.</p>

  <p>Fig-Insects are apparently more numerous in South America than they are in any other part of
  the world; and Fritz-M&uuml;ller has discovered<a id="NtA_465" href="#Nt_465"><sup>[465]</sup></a> a
  number of species there of a very extraordinary character, several of them possessing two forms of
  the male, one winged like the female, the other wingless and so different in character that they
  were considered to belong to a different genus. The wingless male of a species found in
  Madagascar, <i>Kradibia</i> <i>cowani</i>, has the peculiarity of possessing only four legs, the
  middle pair being represented merely by minute two-jointed rudiments. Some of these Insects live
  in galls on the figs. The fig-Insects <span class="pagenum" id="page550"><span
  class="smaller">{550}</span></span>were formerly considered to belong to the Proctotrypidae or to
  the Cynipidae (gall-makers), but there can be no doubt, notwithstanding they differ so much in
  their habits from the parasitic Chalcididae, that they probably belong to the same family. If
  treated as different from Chalcididae, they should be separated as a distinct family rather than
  united with the Cynipidae.<a id="NtA_466" href="#Nt_466"><sup>[466]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It is impossible for us to do more than allude to the extraordinary shapes exhibited by some
  Chalcididae. The genus <i>Thoracantha</i> is specially remarkable in this respect. <i>T.
  latreillei</i> is said to resemble a beetle of the family Mordellidae, and has the wings concealed
  by false wing-cases&mdash;really projections from the thorax&mdash;so that from above the Insect
  bears no resemblance to the other Insects of the Order it really belongs to.</p>

  <p>Howard has called attention to some peculiarities in the pupation of Chalcididae.<a
  id="NtA_467" href="#Nt_467"><sup>[467]</sup></a> Like the Cynipidae, they do not make a silken
  cocoon, but some of them that change to pupae inside the victims on which they were nourished have
  the power of forming oval cells in which to undergo their transformation, and they thus cause a
  peculiar inflation of the skin of their deceased victim, which after death still continues to
  serve as a protection to the destroyers. The statement made by Haliday, and repeated subsequently
  in various works, to the effect that Coryna spins a cocoon under the <i>Aphis</i> in which it has
  lived, is an error, the cocoon being really formed by <i>Praon</i>, a Braconid that is a parasite
  of the <i>Aphis</i>, and on which the Chalcid <i>Pachycrepis (Coryna)</i> lives as a
  hyperparasite. The pupae of some species differ from those of other Hymenoptera, in that the
  integument is hard, and the limbs are soldered to the body as in Lepidoptera. These forms pupate
  external to the victim.</p>

  <p>Fritz M&uuml;ller has recorded that the pupa of an unnamed species of Chalcid that attacks a
  Brazilian ant (<i>Azteca instabilis</i> Forel) is suspended on the wall of the cell the ant lives
  in by its posterior extremity, just like the chrysalis of a butterfly.</p>

  <p>The Ichneumonidae form a family of enormous extent, containing nearly 6000 described species.
  The study of the family is but little advanced, owing to their parasitic habits and to this
  bewildering multiplicity in their specific forms. Most of the species, in the larval state, live
  inside the larvae of Lepidoptera, and they thus keep the myriads of caterpillars within bounds,
  the number of these destroyed by Ichneumons being prodigious. Some of the family are, however,
  external parasites, and some are known to attack Spiders and Insects of other Orders than
  Lepidoptera. Their antennae are not elbowed and are many-jointed, the joints being closely
  compacted, especially towards the extremity. This character readily distinguishes Ichneumonidae
  from the families we have previously considered. The ocelli are well developed even in the
  apterous forms, and are placed in a triangular position on the vertex. The pronotum is small in
  front; and extends backwards at the sides to the points of insertion of the front wings; it is
  fixed to the mesonotum. The wings (Fig. 367, A) have a more complex neuration than those of most
  of the other parasitic Hymenoptera, but are occasionally absent in one or both sexes of a species.
  The metathorax is very small, and the middle and hind legs are placed close together. The
  propodeum is very large, and is frequently covered with a highly-developed sculpture.</p>

  <p>The hind body springs from the lower part of the propodeum; it is usually of slender form, and
  its segmentation is very conspicuous. The females bear an ovipositor, which differs greatly in
  length according to the species, and is known in the case of one species to attain a length six
  times that of the whole of the rest of the body.<a id="NtA_468"
  href="#Nt_468"><sup>[468]</sup></a> The egg is deposited by some species on the skin, by others
  within the body of the victim; it varies much in form and colour, some eggs being stalked and of
  peculiar shape. The larvae issuing from the eggs are legless maggots with a delicate integument of
  pallid white or creamy colour. If the eggs are laid on the surface of the body, the resulting
  larvae (except in the cases of the external parasites) soon bore into the interior of their
  victim, and disappear therein. The changes that take place in the lifetime of the larvae have been
  studied in only a few cases; but if we can judge from Ratzeburg's history<a id="NtA_469"
  href="#Nt_469"><sup>[469]</sup></a> of the changes that take place in <i>Anomalon</i>, they are of
  great interest. From observation of the differences existing amongst a great number of larvae of
  <i>A. circumflexum</i> he distinguished four stages. It is of course impossible to follow directly
  the growth of one individual, because it is concealed in the interior of the caterpillar in which
  it lives, and to open this involves the death of both caterpillar and Ichneumon-larva. The life
  history must therefore be constructed from a great number of separate observations; and it is not
  ascertained that the four instars described by Ratzeburg represent the number of moults of the
  larva that actually take place. He, however, entertained no doubt that all the forms he observed
  <span class="pagenum" id="page553"><span class="smaller">{553}</span></span>were stages in the
  development of one species. In the earliest stage, when only one millimetre in length and about as
  thick as a horse-hair, the larva is free in the interior of the caterpillar's body, and has a
  small head armed only with a pair of mandibles. There are, in addition to the head, thirteen
  segments, and the last of these is an elongate tail forming nearly one-half the length of the
  creature. No trace of tracheae can be discovered. In the second stage the larva is still free, an
  elongate tracheal tube exists, the tail has diminished to half the length, the head has become
  much larger, and rudimentary antennae of one joint are visible; possibly stigmata are present at
  this stage, though they cannot afterwards be detected. In the third stage (Fig. 361, C) the larva
  is encysted, the head is large, the parts of the mouth are all developed, the tracheal system is
  extensive, and the caudal termination of the body is quite short; notwithstanding the extensive
  development of the tracheal system, no stigmata can be found. In the fourth stage the larva is
  still encysted, the tail has disappeared, the head and mouth parts are reduced in size and
  development, and the creature has now the appearance of a normal larva. The changes to pupa and
  perfect Insect take place within the body of the victim, in some cases, if not usually, after it
  has undergone its metamorphosis into a chrysalis. Very little information is extant as to the
  duration of the various stages, but it appears to be the rule that only one generation appears
  annually, though in some cases there are pretty certainly two.</p>

  <p>It is very difficult to observe the act of oviposition; the Ichneumon-flies usually decline to
  notice caterpillars with which they are placed in confinement. Ratzeburg thinks they will only
  attack caterpillars that are in a deficient state of health or vitality. Occasionally we may by a
  happy chance observe the act in Insects at large, and from the records of observers it may be
  deduced with tolerable certainty that the sense of sight takes no part in the operation. Ratzeburg
  relates that he saw a <i>Pimpla</i> alight on a leaf of <i>Rhus</i> and thrust its ovipositor
  through the leaf. On looking to the under-side of the leaf he found that a cocoon of <i>Bombyx
  neustria</i> was concealed there in such a position that it could not have been seen by the
  Ichneumon.</p>

      (After Riley.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Among the most remarkable of the Ichneumon-flies are the Insects of the genera <i>Rhyssa</i>
  and <i>Thalessa</i>. These fine Insects have an ovipositor three or four inches in length, and are
  parasitic on species of the family Siricidae, which, as we have previously described, live in
  solid wood. In order therefore to deposit the egg in a suitable place, the wood must be pierced by
  the Ichneumon. The ovipositor is not only of extreme length, but is also furnished with serrations
  on its apical part, so that it forms a very effective boring apparatus. It is brought into use by
  being bent on itself over the back of the Insect (Fig. 362), so as to bring the tip vertically
  down on to the wood, through which it is then forced by a series of efforts; the sheaths do not
  enter the wood. The egg is laid anywhere in the burrow of the <i>Sirex</i>; the young larva seeks
  its prey, and lives on it as an external parasite (Fig. 342, D). Erne, however, states<a
  id="NtA_470" href="#Nt_470"><sup>[470]</sup></a> that the young larva of <i>Rhyssa persuasoria</i>
  enters its victim, and remains within the latter till its death occurs. This happens when the
  young <i>Rhyssa</i> is two or three lines in length, and it then makes its exit from the interior
  of the body and gradually eats it up. Should the larva it has attacked be of large size, it of
  itself affords sufficient food for the completion of the growth of the <i>Rhyssa</i>. Should the
  <i>Rhyssa</i>, however, have attacked a small larva, this does not furnish it with sufficient
  food, and it consequently dies without seeking another larva. Erne says, indeed, that it will not
  eat another if offered to it, so that in order to rear the <i>Rhyssa</i> in captivity, the victim
  it has first attacked must always be given to it. The same observer states that the <i>Rhyssa</i>
  larva is sometimes transported by the <i>Sirex</i> deep into the wood, so that when it has
  completed its metamorphoses the Ichneumon-fly may find itself buried in solid wood to a depth of
  about two inches. In that case it excavates the wood with its mandibles, and should it fail to
  gain the exterior after <span class="pagenum" id="page555"><span
  class="smaller">{555}</span></span>three days of work, it dies. In the case of <i>Thalessa</i> it
  is stated that it sometimes bores into wood where there are no larvae, but Riley thinks this
  erroneous; it is, on the other hand, certain that the Insect after penetrating the wood is
  frequently unable to withdraw the ovipositor, and consequently dies.</p>

  <p>Packard has recorded,<a id="NtA_471" href="#Nt_471"><sup>[471]</sup></a> without mentioning the
  species, the oviposition of an Ichneumon of which the egg is deposited externally. It was placed
  on the head of the caterpillar, and speedily hatched; the young larva at once bored through the
  prothoracic segment of the victim, the head of the latter then became swollen, and covered the
  opening into the prothorax, made by the parasite.</p>

      egg-shell.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The history of an Ichneumon larva that feeds as an external parasite has been sketched by De
  Geer and Newport. The observations of the latter<a id="NtA_472"
  href="#Nt_472"><sup>[472]</sup></a> refer to <i>Paniscus virgatus</i>; he found small, shining,
  black bodies attached to the skin of the larva of a moth, <i>Mamestra pisi</i>; these were the
  eggs of the Ichneumon. They are furnished with a short peduncle, which is implanted in the skin of
  the victim; the egg, according to De Geer, being retained more firmly by the peduncle subsequently
  swelling, so as to form two knobs. The hatching takes place by the egg-shell splitting
  longitudinally, while from the split protrudes the little head of the destroying larva. This
  becomes fixed to the caterpillar, from which the nutriment is to be drawn; the <i>Paniscus</i>
  larva does not, however, leave the egg-shell, but, on the contrary, becomes adherent to it, so
  that the parasite is in this manner fixed by the two ends to its victim. In fifteen days the
  parasite was full-grown, and had become half an inch in length. At first no tracheae were to be
  seen, but these were detected after the second day. Moulting took place three times, and in a
  peculiar manner, very different from that described by Ratzeburg as occurring in the internal
  parasites (which, he states, change their very delicate skin by detaching it in almost
  imperceptible fragments). In the external parasite the <span class="pagenum" id="page556"><span
  class="smaller">{556}</span></span>skin remains entire, and is shuffled down to the extremity of
  the body, but cannot be completely detached owing to the anchoring of the posterior part of the
  body to the caterpillar; the cast skins thus remain as envelopes to the posterior part of the
  body. Newport states that if the mouth of the parasite be detached, it usually cannot again seize
  hold of the victim, and consequently perishes. It is a curious fact that more eggs than one
  caterpillar can support are habitually placed on it, and some of the resulting larvae of necessity
  perish during the period of growth. Poulton, who has recently made some additional observations on
  the development of <i>Paniscus</i>,<a id="NtA_473" href="#Nt_473"><sup>[473]</sup></a> says that
  if three larvae are close together, it is the middle one that perishes, and suggests that this is
  due to some simple physical condition. From Newport's account it may be gathered that the
  <i>Mamestra</i> retains sufficient vitality to form its cocoon, and that the <i>Paniscus</i>
  larvae likewise construct their own cocoons within that of the <i>Mamestra</i>. In the case of
  <i>Paniscus cephalotes</i> feeding on <i>Dicranura vinula</i>, Poulton relates that the latter
  died after the twelfth day of attack. The parasites, having relaxed their hold on the victim just
  previous to this event, then thrust their heads into the dead body, and devoured the larva,
  leaving only a dried and empty integument. These larvae span a loose sort of web in which to
  undergo their metamorphosis. In a natural state, however, they form cocoons inside the cocoon of
  the <i>Dicranura</i>. The period passed in the pupal condition was about four weeks. This parasite
  only attacks the Lepidopterous larva during the last stage of its existence as a larva, but the
  eggs may be laid on the victim in an earlier stage; and in such case De Geer has stated, and
  Poulton has confirmed the observation, that though the larva sheds its skin it does not get rid of
  the eggs.</p>

  <p>The little Ichneumons of the genus <i>Pezomachus</i> are quite destitute of wings and somewhat
  resemble ants; they are common Insects in Britain. Only the female sex is known, and it is
  believed that the winged Ichneumons assigned to the genus <i>Hemiteles</i>&mdash;of which no
  females are known&mdash;are the males of <i>Pezomachus</i>. Repeated efforts have been made to
  place this beyond doubt, but they have usually failed, for when a brood of these parasites is
  reared, the individuals generally prove to be <span class="pagenum" id="page557"><span
  class="smaller">{557}</span></span>either all <i>Hemiteles</i> or all <i>Pezomachus</i>.  It is to
  be hoped that this interesting case will be fully elucidated.</p>

  <p>Although the Ichneumonidae are perhaps the most purely carnivorous of all the great families of
  Hymenoptera, there is nevertheless reason for supposing that some of them can be nourished with
  vegetable substances during a part at any rate of the larval existence, Giraud and Cameron<a
  id="NtA_474" href="#Nt_474"><sup>[474]</sup></a> having recorded observations that lead to the
  conclusion that some species of the genus <i>Pimpla</i> may inhabit galls and live on the
  substance, or juices thereof.</p>

  <p>Over 1200 species of Ichneumonidae are known to inhabit Britain, and there can be no doubt that
  this number will be increased as a result of further observation. Unfortunately no general work
  has yet been published on this department of our fauna, and the literature is very scattered.<a
  id="NtA_475" href="#Nt_475"><sup>[475]</sup></a> The species of North America have not received so
  much investigation as those of Europe, and the Ichneumon fauna of the tropics remains almost
  uninvestigated. Six sub-families are recognised: Agriotypides, Ichneumonides, Cryptides,
  Tryphonides, Pimplides, Ophionides. Of these the first is the most remarkable, as it consists of
  an Insect having aquatic habits. It has for long been known that the unique species <i>Agriotypus
  armatus</i>, a rare Insect in our islands, is in the habit of going under water and remaining
  there for a considerable period, and it has now been satisfactorily ascertained that it does this
  for the purpose of laying its eggs in the larvae of Trichoptera.<a id="NtA_476"
  href="#Nt_476"><sup>[476]</sup></a> The resultant larva lives inside the cases of species of
  <i>Silo</i>, <i>Go&euml;ra</i>, etc. It undergoes a sort of hypermetamorphosis, as its shape before
  assuming the pupal condition <span class="pagenum" id="page558"><span
  class="smaller">{558}</span></span>is very different to what it was previously. It changes to a
  pupa inside the case of the Trichopteron in a cocoon attached to the walls of the case. Previous
  to making this, however, the <i>Agriotypus</i> forms a curious, elongate, string-like process
  attached to the anterior extremity of its cocoon. The use of this is unknown. Full information as
  to the life-history of this aquatic Hymenopterous larva, especially as to its respiratory
  functions, would be of great interest. The affinities of this remarkable Insect are still
  doubtful. It may probably prove to be between Proctotrypidae and Ichneumonidae.</p>

  <p>The Braconidae are the Ichneumones, or Ichneumonides, adsciti of the older Hymenopterists. They
  are extremely similar to the Ichneumonidae, but the hind body has a much less degree of mobility
  of its segments, and there are some constant distinctions in the wings. Although there is a great
  deal of difference in the various forms of each of the two families, yet there are two points of
  distinction easily appreciated; the series of cells running across the wing (Fig. 367) being only
  three in the Ichneumonides (Fig. 367, A), but four in the Braconids (Fig. 367, B); besides this
  the space <i>a</i> of the Braconid wing is divided into two (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) in the
  Ichneumonid wing. A glance at these characters enables us at once to separate correctly the
  thousands of species of the two families.</p>

  <p>The habits of the Braconidae are similar to those of Ichneumonidae, it being believed that all
  are parasites. Usually they attack larvae, but they are bred in great numbers from pupae, and even
  from imagos of other Insects. <i>Elasmosoma</i> is one of the few parasites known to attack ants.
  As many as 1200 specimens of <i>Microgaster</i> have been reared from a single Lepidopterous
  larva. Although such parasitism raises a feeling of repulsion, yet there is reason for supposing
  that there may be <span class="pagenum" id="page560"><span
  class="smaller">{560}</span></span>little or no cruelty or acute suffering connected with this
  mode of life. The victim attacked is not eaten, the parasites in the interior taking in the lymph
  of the caterpillar either by the mouth or by endosmosis, but not biting their host. The latter
  displays no sign of sickness, but eats voraciously, so that it serves merely as a sort of
  intermediary between the juices of the plant and the larvae inside itself. It is only when the
  metamorphosis is at hand that the host sickens, but this does not always happen: parasitised
  larvae frequently change to pupae, and they may occasionally even become perfect Insects. Cases
  are known in which imagos have appeared with some of the small parasites embedded in some of the
  outer parts of their bodies. These cases are, however, very rare; in the enormous majority of
  instances the host is destroyed either when it is in the larval stage or before the pupa has
  advanced to any great extent on its metamorphosis to an imago. Particulars as to various species
  will be found in the valuable work of Ratzeburg we have already referred to.<a id="NtA_477"

  been recorded by Marshall<a href="#Nt_479"><sup>[479]</sup></a> of a stalked cocoon (Fig. 368)
  being formed as an exceptional act by <i>Apanteles formosus</i>. Mr. Marshall has recently
  received other specimens of this cocoon as well as the Insects reared therefrom in France, and

  from by the Insect for unknown reasons.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page561"><span class="smaller">{561}</span></span></div>

  <p>This family is of enormous extent; we have several hundred species of it in Britain,<a

  undescribed exotic forms. To <i>Apanteles glomeratus</i> we are indebted for keeping our cabbages
  and kindred vegetables from destruction by the caterpillars of the white butterflies. The larvae
  of the various species of <i>Pieris</i>, as well as those of other Lepidoptera, are attacked by
  this little Insect, the masses of whose cocoons may frequently be found in numbers in and near
  cabbage gardens. The tropical species of Braconidae are greatly neglected, but many large and
  remarkable forms&mdash;some of brilliant colours&mdash;have been brought from there, so that we
  are justified in believing that Insects of this family will prove to be very numerous. There are
  but few apterous Braconidae. Both sexes of <i>Chasmodon apterus</i> are destitute of wings; the
  females of one species of <i>Spathius</i>, and also those of <i>Pambolus</i> and <i>Chasmodon</i>
  are apterous; in a small number of species of various genera the wings are so minute as to be
  incapable of serving as organs of flight. In the genus <i>Alloea</i> the wings of the male are
  shorter than those of the female.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This family is constituted by the Australian genus <i>Megalyra</i>,<a id="NtA_482"
  href="#Nt_482"><sup>[482]</sup></a> one of the most interesting of the numerous extraordinary
  Insect-forms found in that region; the species appear to be very rare and not numerous. Apparently
  nothing is known as to their habits. It is quite possible that these Insects will prove to be
  anomalous Braconidae.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Fam. VIII. Evaniidae.</b></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Petiole of the abdomen attached to the upper part of the median dorsal plate;
    antennae not elbowed, of thirteen or fourteen joints. Wings with a moderate number of nervures.
    Larva of parasitic habits.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>This family is composed of only three genera&mdash;<i>Evania</i>, <i>Gasteruption</i>, and
  <i>Aulacus</i>, each possessing a considerable number of species; they agree in the characters
  mentioned above, and may be readily recognised by the peculiar insertion of the hind body. This
  character occurs outside the limits of the Evaniidae only in one or two genera of Chalcididae and
  Braconidae; it is to this latter family that the Evaniidae must be considered most closely
  allied.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The species of the genus <i>Evania</i> are believed to live at <span
  class="pagenum" id="page563"><span class="smaller">{563}</span></span>the expense of cockroaches
  (Blattidae), and to deposit their eggs in the egg-capsules of those Insects. The species of
  <i>Gasteruption</i> live, in the larval state, on the larvae of other Hymenoptera, more especially
  of such as form nests in wood. Very little is known as to the habits of the species of
  <i>Aulacus</i>, but it is believed that they are parasitic on members of the Hymenopterous
  families, Siricidae and Oryssidae. Only the most meagre details as to the life history of any of
  the Evaniidae have been recorded. The species of <i>Evania</i> are met with most freely where
  cockroaches abound, and are said, hence, to be frequently observed on board ship. Two or three
  species of each of the two genera <i>Evania</i> and <i>Gasteruption</i> occur in Britain. The
  latter genus is more widely known under the name of <i>Foenus</i>.<a id="NtA_483"

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Sexes very different; the female without exserted ovipositor, but with

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This family at present comprises, according to Schletterer,<a id="NtA_484"
  href="#Nt_484"><sup>[484]</sup></a> only the three genera <i>Pelecinus</i>, <i>Ophionellus</i>,
  and <i>Monomachus</i>. The systematic position of the Insects is very doubtful, and their habits
  are but little known. <i>Pelecinus polyturator</i> (Fig. 370) appears, however, in the female sex,
  to be a common Insect over a large part of the warmer regions <span class="pagenum"
  id="page564"><span class="smaller">{564}</span></span>of the New World; it is in all probability
  parasitic in its habits, the elongate ovipositor of the female Ichneumon being in this Insect
  replaced by an extraordinary linear extension of the abdomen itself. Doubleday has recorded that
  he saw twenty or thirty specimens of this species that had perished with their elongated hind
  bodies inserted into the stem of a tree, from which they could not extricate themselves. On the
  other hand, Patton thinks they are parasitic on locusts.<a id="NtA_485"
  href="#Nt_485"><sup>[485]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="sp3">The male in <i>Pelecinus</i> has the proportions of the parts of the body normal,
  there being no elongation of the abdomen; it thus differs very much in appearance from the female.
  There seems to be very little to distinguish <i>Pelecinus</i> from Proctotrypidae. The undivided
  trochanters have led to these Insects being placed, by some, among the Aculeate Hymenoptera. This
  character, as we have already shown, occurs also in Proctotrypidae.</p>

  <p class="ac"><b>Fam. X. Trigonalidae.</b></p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">

    twenty-five-jointed. Trochanters imperfectly two-jointed. Both the anterior and posterior wings

  </div>

  <p>This family is chiefly constituted by the very rare Insects contained in the genus
  <i>Trigonalys</i>, of which we have one species in Britain. Although, so far as appearance goes,
  they have little in common with the parasitic Hymenoptera, and look quite like members of the
  Aculeata, yet the late F. Smith found a species in the cells of <i>Polistes lanio</i>, thereby
  showing it to be of parasitic habits. Although some Aculeate Hymenoptera are also of parasitic
  habits, yet the characters of <i>Trigonalys</i> perhaps agree, on the whole, better with the
  Hymenoptera parasitica. The British species is very <span class="pagenum" id="page565"><span
  class="smaller">{565}</span></span>rare. The South American genus, <i>Nomadina</i>, looks still
  more like a bee, and the trochanters are even more imperfectly divided than they are in some of
  the Aculeate group, Nyssonides, the outer portion being merely a small piece imperfectly separated
  from the base of the femur.</p>

    <p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The citation of Saint Augustine on <span class="wnw">p. <a
    href="#page85">85</a></span> is made in the words used by Wasmann in <i>Der Trichterwickler,
    eine naturwissenschaftliche Studie &uuml;ber den Thierinstinkt</i>, 1884.</p>
    <p class="sp0">The authenticity of the passage we have adopted as the motto for this volume is
    somewhat doubtful. It is explained in an "admonitio ad lectorem" of the soliloquy, that this
    work is probably a compilation by a later writer, from two, or more, works of Saint Augustine.
    Father Wasmann has been so kind as to inform the writer that the idea of the passage quoted
    occurs frequently in the undoubted works of the Saint, as, for instance, de Civitate Dei, lib.
    xi. cap. 22; Serm. ccxiii. in traditione symboli II. cap. i.; contra Faustum, lib. xxi. cap. v.
    etc. The passage quoted is, however, the only one in which "angeli" and "vermiculi" are
    associated.</p>

    profit, deriving satisfaction in the one case from the process, in the other from the
    accomplished fact."</p>
    <p><i>TIMES.</i>&mdash;"There are very many, not only among educated people who take an interest
    in science, but even among specialists, who will welcome a work of reasonable compass and handy
    form containing a trustworthy treatment of the various departments of Natural History by men who
    are familiar with, and competent to deal with, the latest results of scientific research....
    Altogether, to judge from this first volume, <i>The Cambridge Natural History</i> promises to
    fulfil all the expectations that its prospectus holds out."</p>
    <p><i>DAILY CHRONICLE.</i>&mdash;"There is no doubt that if the succeeding volumes are carried
    out upon the same plan as is that which we have just received, the <i>Cambridge Natural
    History</i> will be an indispensable work; for it appeals to a far wider class than works upon
    Natural History generally do.... It can be read with profit by the zoologist, and there is a
    vast amount of matter which is interesting to those who like the tit-bits of science, but do not
    care so much for the more serious aspects of the subject."</p>
    <p><i>DAILY NEWS.</i>&mdash;"Promises to be, in its own department of science, the most
    important work of the day."</p>
    <p><i>FIELD.</i>&mdash;"We know of no book available to the general reader which affords such a
    vast fund of information on the structure and habits of molluscs."</p>

    History</i> will rank as one of the finest works on Natural History ever published."</p>

    numerous illustrations are clear and accurate."</p>
    <p><i>ATHEN&AElig;UM.</i>&mdash;"The series certainly ought not to be restricted in its circulation to
    lecturers and students only; and if the forthcoming volumes reach the standard of the one here
    noticed, the success of the enterprise should be assured."</p>

    <p>The wings, by many morphologists, are not included in the category of "appendages"; they
    apparently, however, differ but little in their nature from legs, both being outgrowths of the
    integument; the wings are, however, always post-embryonic in actual appearance, even when their
    rudiments can be detected in the larva. No insect is hatched from the egg in the wing-bearing
    form.</p>

    <p>We may mention that fossil Insects are chiefly determined from their wing-remains, which are
    often surprisingly perfect. This is one of the reasons that have induced us to prefer a
    classification of Insects in which the nature of the wings is considered of great value. It
    would be impossible to refer fossil Insects to groups that are established on account of the
    metamorphosis or of the internal structure of their components, for there is not yet any
    evidence on either of these points in the fossil remains preserved for us by the rocks.</p>

    <p>The genera <i>Atropos</i> and <i>Clothilla</i> were named after the two fates Atropos and
    Clotho. Westwood attempted some years ago to complete the trio by establishing a genus
    <i>Lachesilla</i>. This proved a failure, the genus being a misconception. As the name Lachesis
    is in use in various branches of zoology, the desired circle of Psocid fates is likely to remain
    always incomplete.</p>

    <p>The term inquiline is applied in entomology to a great variety of conditions covered by the
    Latin word "inquilinus" (incolinus), signifying a tenant or dweller in another's property. The
    term parasite is used in a still wider and vaguer sense, being in fact applied to a large number
    of cases, in many of which we do not at present understand the exact relations between the two
    parties concerned. This subject is no doubt destined to become a most interesting department of
    entomology. See Riley, <i>P. ent. Soc. Washington</i>, ii. 1893, p. 397; and Wasmann,
    <i>Zusammengesetzten Nester</i>, etc., 1891.</p>
